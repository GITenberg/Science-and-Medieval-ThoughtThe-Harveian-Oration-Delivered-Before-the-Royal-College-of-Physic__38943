<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: 0.8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">I</span>N the Middle Ages the old world had passed,
and the vision of a new world came near to
the eager and passionate hearts of many peoples.
Lincoln and Wells, Amiens and Chartres, Florence
and Assisi tell us of the glory of that vision; and
bear witness of its flight: for with Gilbert, Galileo,
Harvey and Newton the Middle Ages themselves
became a phantom, and again the spirit of a
new world appeared. Thus in the phases of
time the world dies and is born again; fulfilling
greater destinies. But the new are born in the
cold bed of the elder worlds, and the young life
is chilled, or a lustier offspring turns unnaturally
to curse the dead; so in their decrepitude lay
the Middle Ages upon modern life; and the Middle
Ages were accursed, until certain pious men sought
to reanimate their vestments and their formulas,
and to set the hands back on the dial of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
centuries; as manyminded man seeks wistfully to
reanimate the simple wonders and beliefs of his
childhood. Their ministry was no more than pious;
the method of modern history wins the fruits of the
past while casting away the shadow of its withered
branches. This comparative method, first applied
to the art and romance of the Middle Ages, so that
every dilettante may now discourse to us of their
evolution, has been applied also to the thought of
the period; but its results, laid up in the closets
of a few scholars, are as yet unfamiliar. It may
then become one, who in no sense a scholar has
strayed into these secret places, to try to distribute
some lessons of the medieval thought which, to
many of us, seems as sere and outworn as did the
relics of Gothic shrines to our great-grandfathers.
For, as in those medieval generations which lay
nearest us the furnace had cooled, impatiently we
had thrown metal and dross aside, and let our
contempt for the dryness and pedantry of its latter
days prevent our vision of the earlier time when
the passion for knowledge bore up the world,
and sought even to contain it. That dogma is not
eternal is manifest to every wanderer in the streets
of Toledo, yet the historian may well recall us to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the study of a time when, by mystical or intellectual
inspirations, men strove eagerly to know the
meaning of life, its origins, and its issues; and
may lead us to the discovery of the seeds and
wells of its fertility. The Greeks prophesied that
before man can determine his place and service
in this world he must form some theory of the
world as a whole; the ages of faith prophesied
that great deeds must be born of great faith
and of great conceptions.</p>

<p>To those who live only in the past, or only
in the present, there seems in the discriminations
of the comparative historian to be a certain
cold-bloodedness. Are not the ears of this critic,
so aloof from the murmuring of creed and controversy,
are they not deaf to the voices of the
spirit which he would interpret to us? A distinguished
bishop who was among my hearers,
with the fervour and gentle humour so well known
in him, rallied me not for celebrating science but
for putting religion to rout. Yet in our own day
surely the argument is changed, not in form only
but in very nature; so changed by the conceptions
of evolution, which have entered the mind
of churchman and layman alike, that not a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
speculative beliefs are changing sides without the
knowledge of the disputants; and he who thinks
himself a defender of the faith may have joined the
revolt. But if we no longer carry the colours of
the troops of the past we shall collect our lessons
from its strategies; and for one of these lessons a
prelate of the King will give thanks with me,
that his supremacy has palsied the arm of the
inquisitor to strengthen that of the apostle.</p>

<p class="tb">An unsystematic reader of a subject finds
it out of his power to make due acknowledgment
of the help and advantage derived from expert
authors. Much of the matter had seeded itself
insensibly in his brain in the course of general
reading and conversation; much of it again had
been obtained more carefully from sources now
forgotten. To the following authors I know I
am profoundly indebted, as I am to many others

others, to show the extent to which modern physiology, from Harvey
onwards, is based upon vivisection; and that it could not have arisen or

<h3>INTRODUCTION<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>.</h3>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: 0.8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">I</span>N the many Harveian Orations which have been
delivered since the death of the founder of modern
physiology the direct aspects of his honour and of his
work have been exhausted; of late years the orators
have concerned themselves with indirect aspects. Some
of my friends have said to me that they lack a perspective
view of Harvey and his work; that even highly
educated men have little sense of his relation to
medieval thought, or of the evolution of medieval into
modern thought. Of the several stars of the constellation&mdash;of
Copernicus, Gilbert, Galileo, Harvey&mdash;they had
some knowledge; but how came Harvey to be at Padua?
how did science spring up in North Italy? did science
arise out of the womb of medicine, or contrariwise? why
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>did natural science not flourish in the thirteenth century,
and was it not a great misfortune for Europe that it did
not then flourish? what were the systems of thought
which in the Middle Ages preceded, encouraged or
thwarted the travail of the human mind, and what of
good or ill do we owe to them? These and such questions
it seemed not unfitting that a Harveian Orator of
this latter day should consider. Now on the philosophy
of the Middle Ages, and on its relation to the era of
positive science of which Harvey was perhaps the chief
pioneer, there lay in a drawer in my cabinet the confused
and occasional notes of many years. An interest in this
thorny subject, sown in my mind at first by accident,
and reawakened by these enquiring friends, had for me
the charms of an old fancy, and I trust some brief
essay thereon may have a temporary service; if, that
is, I can touch the imagination of my hearers, and after
some broken fashion bring before them a vision of the
nations swayed hither and thither upon the face of
Europe by a thirst for knowledge of a kind different,
both in its methods and in its aims, from our own.</p>

<p>This oration cannot have the merit of an original
study. Had I the equipment I have not the leisure to
carry my investigations to the sources. Yet I may have
attained to some maturity of judgment herein by long
occupation of my mind since, in 1863, my old friend
Mr Thomas Marshall of Leeds, sometime of St John&#8217;s
College, Oxford, interested me in the life and work of
Roger Bacon, the only eminent forerunner of the great
naturalists of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>The art of the Middle Ages and the social and
political history of the time have fascinated modern
Europe; for medieval thought, though its phrases survive
in their mouths, few persons have shown any care:
yet to these conflicts we owe what we are. No great
battles of mankind have been fought in vain; none of
its great captains has deserved oblivion. Yet we shrug
our shoulders at their uncouth or outlandish names;
we assume that from their chairs there issued naught
but rhetoric, casuistries and fallacies, and that their
multitudinous disciples were silly moths.</p>

<p>Each period of human achievement has its phases
of spring, culmination, and decline; and it is in its
decline that the leafless tree comes to judgment. In
the unloveliness of decay the Middle Ages are as other
ages have been, as our own will be: but in those
ages there was more than one outburst of life; more
than once the enthusiasm of the youth of the West
went out to explore the ways of the realm of ideas;
and, if we believe ourselves at last to have found the
only thoroughfare, we owe this knowledge to those who
before us travelled the uncharted seas. If we have
inherited a great commerce and dominion of science it is
because their argosies had been on the ocean, and their
camels on the desert. &#8220;Discipulus est prioris posterior
dies&#8221;; man cannot know all at once; knowledge
must be built up by laborious generations. In all times,
as in our own, the advance of knowledge is very largely
by elimination and negation; we ascertain what is not
true, and we weed it out. To perceive and to respect the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
limits of the knowable we must have sought to transgress
them. We can build our bridge over the chasm of
ignorance with stored material in which the thirteenth
century was poor indeed, we can fix our bearings where
then was no foundation; yet man may be well engaged
when he knows not the ends of his work; and the
schoolmen in digging for treasure cultivated the field of
knowledge, even for Galileo and Harvey, for Newton and
Darwin. Their many errors came not of indolence, for
they were passionate; not of hatred of light, for they
were eager for the light; not of fickleness, for they
wrought with unparalleled devotion; nor indeed of
ignorance of particular things, for they knew many
things: they erred because they did not know, and
they could not know, the conditions of the problems
which, as they emerged from the cauldron of war and
from the wreck of letters and science, they were
nevertheless bound to attack, if civil societies worthy of
the name were to be constructed. How slow in gestation
is the mother of truth we may see by comparing the
schoolmen of the second medieval period with those of
the first; in the enlargement of their view, the better
furniture of their minds, and the deeper meaning of
their distinctions: and when we compare with these
later schoolmen the naturalists of the seventeenth
century, we find not new acquirements only but also a
new direction of the pursuit of truth.</p>

<p>It seems hardly comprehensible that great and stable
societies have been built up on transcendental schemes
of thought, upon conceptions poised as it were in the air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Without a system of morals no civil society could exist;
yet if mankind must have waited for civil polity until
some such system were built up from below, of scientifically
tested materials, social constructions would have
been virtually impossible. In morals, as in the arts,
the art precedes the science; the intuitions of genius
imagine social schemes of provisional validity, and new
and lofty standards of fitness. But a social fabric thus
born of a vision can bear no rough handling; and even
the solid builders who would make a more permanent
foundation upon positive conceptions, while seeking
more or less deliberately to underpin the fabric, may,
and often do, shake it to ruin.</p>

<p>Hence in all guardians of morals the dread of
meddling with the reigning vision of truth; hence its
sanctity, that no man shall try the stuff of which it is
made. And the dangers of heresies from within are more
fearful than those of alien attacks; social cohesion, the
end of it all, is thereby more exposed to disintegration.
Yet nevertheless, as the generations of men change,
and as knowledge increases, men see from new points of
view; and thus while for some the reigning vision retains
its apparent solidity, for others its rays are broken or
dissolved. Even John Henry Newman was compelled
to teach the relativity of truth, and that a doctrine
of development must be accepted. For every provisional
synthesis then the time must come when the apparition
of truth can no longer command united allegiance,
and criterions begin to encroach upon sanctions.
Broader and more stable foundations have, it is true,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
been rising almost insensibly, yet it may be long ere
the superstructure rise into the heavenly light; in the
lower work many will see no beauty and no hope, others
will see safety in its enlargement and solidity. By
these indeed the visions of the imagination are apt
to be forgotten, or in the pressure of intellectual verification
even despised; the mean level of conception
may not indeed be lower, it may haply be higher, yet
the highest, wherein truth may be revealed by illumination,
is not divined in its full force, abundance and
life. Great seers are wont to leave to others to find out,
or even to care, what bottom they stood upon; yet only
through transitory periods of a humbler duty than theirs
can the bases be laid and enlarged for times of richer
fruition. One of the profoundest of modern sayings was
that of Freeman&mdash;that the end of modern material progress
is to bring large societies up to the level of small
ones.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>In some respects I am ill equipped for my
office; of the history of the practice of Medicine
from the time of Galen to the time of Harvey
I am almost ignorant, I fear wilfully ignorant.
Well indeed may we turn our eyes away from
those centuries wherein one of the chief callings
of man fell into unexampled and even odious
degradation; yet I trust that in me this ignorance
and this aversion may be compensated by
some familiarity with the history of thought in the
Middle Ages, a familiarity acquired during thirty-six
years of abiding interest, and occasional study.</p>

<p>The discovery of the circulation of the blood
by William Harvey is commonly regarded among
scientific discoveries as pre-eminent if not unique.
I can quote but two opinions on this matter, both
taken beyond our own land. In France, Dr Daremberg
exclaims &#8220;Voici Harvey! Comme au jour
de la cr&eacute;ation le chaos se d&eacute;brouille, la lumi&egrave;re se
s&eacute;pare des t&eacute;n&egrave;bres!&#8221; In Germany, Dr Baas says
that Harvey stands alone in respect of the world
of life; that his discovery of the inner working of
the microcosm takes a place equal to, if not indeed
higher than, those of Copernicus, Kepler and
Newton in respect of the macrocosm. It will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
my endeavour to show that these judgments are
historically justifiable.</p>

<p>To put the discovery of the systemic circulation
of the blood in its true light, we must
have some notion of the history of philosophy,
science and medicine. Medicine, and herein it is
in contrast with Theology and Law, had its sources
almost wholly in the Greeks. Not only in the
doctrine of the four elements of Empedocles, a
doctrine which has survived almost to our own
day<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>, and in the physical theories of Heraclitus
and Leucippus, did medicine, for good or ill, first
find a scheme of thought, but in the schools of
Hippocrates and of Alexandria it was based also,
and far more soundly, upon natural history and
anatomy. The noble figure of Galen, the first experimental
physiologist and the last of the great Greek
physicians, portrayed for us by Dr Payne in the
Harveian Oration of 1896, stood eminent upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>brow of the abyss when, as if by some convulsion
of nature, medicine was overwhelmed for fifteen
centuries. To the philosophy of medicine, Galen
had given more than enough; to its natural history
he had contributed in the following of Hippocrates;
to its discoveries he had given the greatest of all
means of research, individual genius; to its methods
he had given, but in vain, that indispensable method,
practised first perhaps in history by Archimedes
and the Alexandrians, of verification by experiment;
a method, after Galen, virtually lost till the time of
Gilbert, of Galileo and of Harvey.</p>

<p>In the growth of human societies small civilisations,
however exquisite, have been sacrificed to
the formation of vaster and vaster congregations
of men; thus only, it would seem, is an equilibrium
to be reached of sufficient stability for the
highest ends of mankind. Greece, beautiful as was
her bloom, penetrating as was her spirit, perhaps
because of her very freedom of thought, never
became a nation; her city states were too wilful
to combine. The Macedonian power broadened
the foundation of polity eastward and westward;
and this work was carried as far perhaps as sword
and fasces could carry it by the power of Rome.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
But even the Roman peace, bought as it was at
the cost of learning and the arts, was but a
mechanical peace; in the wilder, more turbulent
and more heterogeneous peoples of the later Empire
the bodies but not the wills of men were in subjugation.
The great system of Roman Law, which
Numa, the Moses of Rome, had invested with
supernatural awe, had become but an external
rule; even in Rome herself, poorer in people,
poorer in commerce, poorer than ever in ideas,
the sanction of patriotism was failing, and her
citizens were held together for the most part by
their baser and more dangerous passions<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>. For
Eastern Europe the University of Constantinople
established a compact and uniform system of
thought, subtle prolix and acquisitive rather than
original or profound; but in the West, under the
Frank and later Northern devastations, the very
traditions of learning and obedience were broken
up; schools were closed, and even the art of
writing was almost lost. Then it was that the
cohesion and development of Western Europe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>were saved by a new and a wonderful thing.
From the East, the home of religions, had spread,
like an exhalation, Christianity, that religion
which proves by its survival that it is the fittest
sanction for the will of man. This religion, entering
as a new spirit into the ancient fabric of
Roman Empire, was to hold men&#8217;s service
in heart and soul as well as in body; yet to
this end no mere mystic or personal religion
could suffice: clothing itself with the political and
ritual pride and even with the mythology of the
pagan Empire it inspired a new adoration; but it
imposed also upon Europe a catholic and elaborated
creed. To preserve the authority of the
common faith not only must every knee be bowed,
not only must every heart be touched, but to build
and to repair its fabric every mind must also bring
its service. How the scheme of the Faith was built
up, how oriental ecstasy and hellenistic subtlety,
possessing themselves of the machinery of Roman
pomp, were wrought to this end, we may briefly
consider.</p>

<p>As, politically, under Diocletian and Constantine
the ancient world gave place to the new, so in
the third century philosophy was born again in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
neo-platonism<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>, the offspring of the coition of East
and West in Alexandria, where all religions and
all philosophies met together. The world and the
flesh were crucified that by the spirit, man might
enter into God<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>. Pure in its ethical mood, neo-platonism,
says Harnack, led surely to intellectual
bankruptcy; the irruption of the barbarians was
not altogether the cause of the eclipse of natural
knowledge: to transcendental intuition the wisdom
of the world had become foolishness. Yet even
then, as again and again, came the genius of Aristotle
to save the human mind. The death of
Hypatia was the death of the School of Alexandria,
but in Athens neo-platonism survived and grew.
Proclus, ascetic as he was, was versed also
in Aristotle; and he compelled the Eastern
mysteries into categories: so that on the closure
of the School of Athens by Justinian (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 529)
a formal philosophy was bequeathed to the Faith;
the first scholastic period was fashioned, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>objects and methods of enquiry were determined
for thirty generations. From Aristotle Europe
adopted logic first, and then metaphysics, yet both
in method and in purpose Origen and Augustine
were platonists; rationalised dogma lived upon
dialectic, and conflicted with mysticism; but logic,
dogma and mysticism alike disdained experience.</p>

<p>Thus, no mere external sanction, stood the
Faith; threefold: from the past it brought its
pompous ritual, it appealed by its subtle dogmatic
scheme to the intellects, and by its devotion
to the hearts of men. Through the mirage of it,
when its substance had waned, Copernicus, Galileo,
and Harvey had to steer by the compass of the
experimental method. This was their chief adversity,
and of other adversities I have to speak.</p>

<p>The visitor to the Dominican Church of St
Catherine at Pisa will see on its walls St Thomas
of Aquino with the Holy Scriptures in his hand;
prostrate beneath him is Averroes with his Great
Commentary, but beside him Plato bearing the
Tim&aelig;us. It was the fortune of the Faith that,
of all the treatises of Plato, the Tim&aelig;us, the
most fantastic and the least scientific, should
have been set apart to instruct the medieval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
world; that the cosmical scheme of the Tim&aelig;us,
apparelled in the Latin of Chalcidius,&mdash;for there
were then no Greek texts in the libraries of the
West,&mdash;should for some 500 years have occupied
that theoretical activity which Aristotle regarded
as the highest good of man<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>. Again, those
works of. Aristotle which might have made for
natural knowledge fell out of men&#8217;s hands<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>, while
in them, as Ab&eacute;lard tells us of himself, lay the
Categories, the Interpretation, and the Introduction
of Porphyry to the Categories, all in
the Latin of Boetius<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>; treatises which made for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>peripatetic nominalism, but whereby men were
versed rather in logic and rhetoric than in
natural science. Thus Plato&#8217;s chimera of the
human microcosm, a reflection of his theory of
the macrocosm, stood beside the Faith as the
second great adversary of physiology.</p>

<p>The influence of authority, by which Europe
was to be welded together, governed all human
ideas. As in theology was the authority of
the Faith, so in the science and medicine of the
first period of the Middle Ages was that of
the neo-platonic doctrines, and, in the second
period, of the Arabian versions of Galen and of
Aristotle; furthermore in this rigid discipline metallic
doctrine almost necessarily overbore life and
freedom. It is not easy for us to realise a time
when intellectual progress&mdash;which involves the
successive abandonment of provisional syntheses&mdash;was
unconceived; when truths were regarded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>as stationary; when reasons were not tested but
counted and balanced; when even the later Averroists
found final answers either in Aristotle or in
Galen<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>. Thus in the irony of things it came to
pass that Harvey was withstood by the dogma of
Galen who, in his own day, had passionately
appealed from dogma to nature.</p>

<p>Porphyry of Tyre, who lived in the 3rd century,
may be called the founder of both Arabian and
Christian scholastics. He was an Alexandrian, but
of peripatetic rather than platonic opinions. In
the Isagoge, or Introduction to the Categories,
already mentioned as translated by Boetius about
500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, he set forth plainly a problem which
during the Middle Ages rent Western Europe
asunder; a problem which, says John of Salisbury<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>engaged more of the time and passions of men
than for the house of C&aelig;sar to conquer and
govern the world; one indeed which even in
our day and country is not wholly resolved.</p>

<p>The controversy lay between the Realists<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>the Nominalists; and the issues of it, in the
eleventh century,&mdash;at which time the &#8220;Dark Ages&#8221;
passed into the earlier of the two periods of the
Middle Ages,&mdash;were formulated on the realist side
by William of Champeaux, while the Breton Rousselin,
or Roscellinus, had the perilous honour of
defining them on behalf of the nominalists<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>. To
see the depth of the difference we must step back
a little, to a time when metaphysics and psychology
were not distinguished from other spheres of
science<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>, and all research had for its object the
nature of being. Plato himself held ideas not as
mere abstractions but in some degree as creative
powers; and we shall see how potent this function
became in the thought of the Middle Ages when,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>in the ardour of research into the nature of being,
the modes of individuating principles were distinguished
or contrasted with an ingenuity incomprehensible
to Plato or Aristotle, or at any rate
undesired by these greater thinkers. Aristotle
avoided the question whether form or matter
individuate; he held that there is no form and
no matter extrinsic to the individual. But by the
medieval realist every particular, every thing, was
regarded as after some fashion the product of
universal matter and individual form. Now &#8220;form&#8221;
might be regarded, and severally was regarded, as
a shaping, determinative force or principle, pattern
type or mould, having real existence apart from
stuff, or, on the other hand, as an abstract principle
or pattern having no existence but as a conception
of the mind of the observer. The realists
roundly asserted that form is as actual as matter,
and that things arise by their participation&mdash;without
whiteness no white thing, without humanity no
man; and not individuals only: for the realist, out-platonising
Plato, genera and species also had their
forms, either pre-existent (&#8220;universalia ante rem&#8221;),
or continuously evolved in the several acts of
creation (&#8220;universalia in re&#8221;). Indeed for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
extreme realist every &#8220;predicamental modality&#8221;
was &#8220;aliquid ens separatum&#8221;; for instance, the soul,
the active intellect, the passive intellect, and so on:
conversely, by fusing idea with will, for other
philosophers realism would get pushed back into
efficient reason or divine will, and almost vanish<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>.
By this latter route the Sorbonne, originally opposed
to the Thomists, became nominalist after all; as
did those once pious realists the Augustinians
and Cistercians. Setting aside then the extreme
nominalists, who would have dissolved thought by
declaring all creatures to be so individual as to
be incomparable,&mdash;&#8220;pulverising existence into detached
particulars,&#8221; as some one has put it&mdash;and
that names of kinds are mere nouns, or indeed
mere air (&#8220;flatus vocis&#8221;), the prevalent nominalists
were content to deny to ideas, forms, principles, or
abstractions any other existence than as functions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>of the human mind&mdash;as subjective conceptions.
For Ockham, says Haur&eacute;au, an idea was but a
modality of the thinking subject. Abstractions
then for these thinkers were but mental machinery
for analysis of the concrete. Aristotle was as
obscure and inconsistent in his language herein,
and often elsewhere, as he was profound and scrupulous;
but when his works came to be studied as
a whole, and in the original tongue, the influence
of his method, rather than the close consistency
of his language, told against realism: virtually he
was a conceptualist, and he found reality, where
Plato denied it, in the particular object of sense<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>
<p>Even Francis Bacon, who was deeply indebted to
Aristotle, never extricated himself from the tangle
of form, cause and law<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>.</p>

<p>Now this was a great argument, no empty
dispute; the bones of dead controversies cumber
the ground, but no controversy was empty which
moved profoundly the minds and passions of men:
both for ecclesiastical and secular thought the
dispute was grave. While realism was essential
to the Church&mdash;for instance, on realist grounds
St Anselm defended the medieval doctrine of the
Trinity against Roscellinus; the Church herself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>claimed a real existence apart from the wills of successive
generations of individual and variable men;
she taught that Man had fallen not only in many
or all individual cases, but as a kind having a real
existence<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>, and again that in the Mass there is change
of hypostasis<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>&mdash;while then realism was essential to
the Faith, yet if forms pre-exist (&#8220;ante rem&#8221;) then
the acts of God must be predetermined&mdash;&#8220;fatis&#8221;
non &#8220;avolsa voluntas&#8221;; or if forms are only &#8220;in re&#8221;
God must be form, living in each and every act
and thing, which is Pantheism (&#8220;materia omnium
Deus&#8221;): an impersonal conception and a dissolution
of dogma which the Church must and did abhor.
&#8220;Pessimus error&#8221;&mdash;there is the abyss, cried Albert,
avoiding it by dialectical juggles. Erigena, the brilliant
prophet and protestant<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> of the first period of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>the scholastic philosophy, was virtually a pantheist
after the pattern of Parmenides<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>; as Spinoza was
the last great realist. David of Dinan again was
such a pantheist, though luckily for him the Church
did not find it out till he was dead; and he was
martyred only in his bones. Indeed the great
Robert of Lincoln barely escaped the accusation
of pantheism under the wing of Augustine. The
heresies of David, and of Amaury, caused the
reaction of the first years of the 13th century
against Aristotle. Amaury seems indeed to have
cleared out Christian dogma pretty thoroughly,
and to have preached the coming of science as the
&#8220;third age&#8221; of the world. Many of his followers
were sent to the stake; by the Synod of Paris
(1209) the works of Aristotle were proscribed, and
many copies of them burned. This proscription
was virtually withdrawn by Gregory the Ninth in
1231; and Hales, Albert and St Thomas devoted
themselves again to the study of Aristotle, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>established his supremacy<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>. Indispensable then
as realism was for the Church, its creed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>its sacraments, yet therein it found itself in a
dilemma between the conceptions of a Creator
working under conditions, and of a spirit immanent
in matter; and when theological philosophy
culminated in St Thomas, and was fixed by him as
it now rules in Rome, this difficulty was rather concealed
in his system than resolved<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>. Every scheme of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>thought must make some declaration on the nature
and place of universals; the problem was no hair
splitting<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>, it dealt with the very nature and origin
of being; it agitated the minds of thinking men
at a time of the most fervid and widespread enthusiasm
for knowledge which the Western world
has ever known,&mdash;at a time when Oxford counted
its students by thousands, and when in Paris a
throng athirst for knowledge would stretch from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>the cloisters of the Mathurins to the faubourg of
St Denis<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>; and, in respect of our theme of this day,
we shall see that even Harvey was embarrassed by
certain aspects of it.</p>

<p>For, to resume, closely allied to the argument
concerning universals was that concerning &#8220;form and
matter.&#8221; Whether the terms used were &#8220;form and
matter,&#8221; force or energy or &#8220;pneuma&#8221; and matter,
&#8220;soul or life&#8221; and &#8220;body,&#8221; &#8220;determinative essence
and determinate subsistence,&#8221; &#8220;male principle and
female element,&#8221; &#8220;arch&aelig;us and body,&#8221; the potter
and the clay of the potter; or whether again they
were &#8220;type and individual,&#8221; &#8220;cause and effect,&#8221;
&#8220;law and nature,&#8221; &#8220;becoming and being,&#8221; or even
the &#8220;thought and extension&#8221; of Descartes, the
riddle lay in the contrast of the static and dynamic
aspects of things; in the incessant formation of
variable and transitory individuals in the eternal
ocean of existence<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>For early thinkers, untrained in the methods
and unaware of the limits of thought, even for
the great and free thinkers of Greece, a captivating
analogy was irresistible<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>; while inventing
schemes of thought they believed themselves to
be describing the processes of nature. Moreover
it has been the temptation of philosophers of all
times, and even of Harvey himself than whom
none had put better the conditions of scientific
method, to suppose that by means of abstraction
kinds may be apprehended; that thus they may
get nearer to the inmost core of things; that by
purging away the characters of individuals they
may detect the essence and cause of individuation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
(&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;): not perceiving indeed that
the content of notions is, as Ab&eacute;lard had pointed
out plainly, in inverse proportion to their universality.
Like Sidney&#8217;s hooded dove, the blinder
they were the higher they strove<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>. For example:
from a lump of silver a medal is struck; from
many lumps of silver many medals are struck,
each different from the other: let us eliminate as
accidents the notions of silver, of the blow of a
hammer, even of particular features of the devices,
and we shall reach the idea of an agent with a type
or seal, or of such an agent with many seals, or ideas,
who may thus individualise indifferent matter;
or, to penetrate deeper into abstraction, who may
transfer forms of his own activity to motionless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>stuff. It is my part to-day to show that before
motionless stuff&mdash;before the problem of the &#8220;primum&#8221;
mobile&#8221;&mdash;even Harvey himself stood helpless;
helpless yet fascinated by the indulgence of
invention when, in the <i>De motu cordis</i>, or the
<i>De generatione</i>, he permitted himself to carry
contemplation beyond the sphere of his admirable
experiments. &#8220;Natural, vital and animal spirits&#8221;
indeed he would have none of; saying well that he
should want as many spirits as functions, and that
to introduce such agents as artificers of tissues is
to go beyond experience: yet in his need of a
motor for his machine he was not able to divest
himself of the language nor even of the philosophy
of his day; he referred the cause of the motion of
the blood, and therefore of the heart, to innate
heat<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>. In his day he could not but regard rest and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>motion as different things; and motion as a super-added
quality. In denying the older opinion<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> that
the heart is the source of motion, of perfection<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
and of heat, he put the difficulty but one stage back;
and, when in the treatise on Generation he propounded
his transcendental notion of the impreg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>nation
of the female by the conception of a &#8220;general
immaterial idea,&#8221; we find in him realism still very
much alive indeed. Had Harvey been content with
innate heat he would have done well enough; but
the innate heat of the blood, as he explains it, is
not fire nor derived from fire; nor is the blood
occupied by a spirit, but is a spirit: it is also
&#8220;celestial in nature, the soul, that which answers
to the essence of the stars ... is something analogous
to heaven, the instrument of heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>In denying that a spirit descends and stows
itself in the body, as &#8220;an extraneous inmate,&#8221;
Harvey advances beyond Cremoninus, who then
taught in the chair of Averroistic philosophy in
Padua; for, says Harvey, I cannot discover this
spirit with my senses, nor any seat of it. In another
passage indeed Harvey warns us &#8220;not to derive
from the stars what is in truth produced at home&#8221;;
in yet another he tells us that philosophers produce
principles as indifferent poets thrust gods upon
the stage, to unravel plots and to bring about
catastrophes: yet he concludes that &#8220;the spirit in
the blood acting superiorly to the powers of the
elements, ... the soul in this spirit and blood, is
identical with the essence of the stars.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>Thus the riddle which oppressed these great
thinkers, from the Ionians to Lavoisier, was in part
the nature of the &#8220;impetum faciens<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>&#8221;&mdash;of the Bildungstrieb.
What makes the ball to roll? Does
heart move blood or blood move heart; and in
either case what builds the organ and what bestows
and perpetuates the motion? Albert of Cologne,
and at times even Aristotle, as we have seen,
were apt to leave moving things for abstract
motion, and to regard formulas as agents. Telesius
again, the first of the brilliant band of natural
philosophers in Italy of the <span class="smcap">xvi</span>th and <span class="smcap">xvii</span>th
centuries, was still seeking this principle of nature
in the &#8220;form&#8221; of the peripatetics. Gilbert regarded
his magnetic force as &#8220;of the nature of soul, sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>passing
the soul of man.&#8221; Galileo, although willing
to conceive circular motion as perpetual<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>, and even
self-existent, was unable thus to conceive rectilineal
motion.</p>

<p>Harvey, then, and other naturalists of the
time, including C&aelig;salpinus and after a fashion
even Descartes, followed the medieval world and
Aristotle in deriving the source of motion directly
from the spheres. Harvey says with Dante,
&#8220;Questi nei cuor mortali &egrave; permotore.&#8221; The attraction
exercised by external supreme mind (not
associated with matter) and its thoughts bring the
material cosmos and its parts into regular movements.
The so-called &#913;&#7984;&#952;&#8053;&#961;, or fifth element,
&#8220;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#8049;&#961;&#969;&#957;, &#7936;&#954;&#8053;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#8057;&#957; &#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;&#8221;
(De C&aelig;lo, cap. 2 and vid. Zeller II. ii. 437),
under the name of the Quintessence, played a large
part in the speculations of Lulli, Paracelsus and
other chemical mystics. Till Copernicus transfigured
the cosmos, and Galileo and Newton carried terrestrial
physics into the celestial world, the heavenly
bodies were regarded as animated beings, themselves
set in motion by spheres, and, by propagation
of their intense activity from sphere to sphere,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>animating all sublunary matter, wheels within
wheels, even to its innermost particles. Aristotle&#8217;s
view (Metaph. <span class="smcap">xi.</span>) was as follows:&mdash;The stars
and planets are in their nature eternal essences;
that which moves them must itself be eternal, and
prior and external to that which it causes to be
moved; likewise that which is prior to essence
must itself be essence; and so on for a hierarchy
of eternal essences: thus Heaven if not God is a
divine embodiment (&#920;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945;); and this &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#963;&#969;&#956;&#8049;&#964;&#969;&#957;
he regarded as the essence of heaven
and stars, and the cause of animal heat in living
beings. Thus the transition from Aristotle to the
later conception of the celestial bodies as themselves
animated beings was easy; indeed the attribution
of intelligence to the spheres goes back
at any rate to Plato (Tim&aelig;us), if not to Pythagoras;
and was the foundation of astrology. In
Harvey&#8217;s time there was still in Rome a basilica of
the Seven Angels (the planetary essences). Much
of this doctrine Harvey probably got from Cicero
(Acad. <span class="smcap">i.</span> ii. 39 and De Fin. <span class="smcap">iv.</span> 5-12; vid. Krische),
who speaks of &#8220;ardor c&oelig;li&#8221; as the whole astral
sphere. If I am not mistaken Harvey somewhere
advises Aubrey to study Cicero.</p>

<p>Of the origin of energy we have not solved the
riddle, we have given it up; but instead of coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>from without we know that it comes from within.
As Mr Benn puts it, we have extended the atomistic
method from &#8220;matter&#8221; to motion. Harvey&#8217;s contemporary,
Francis Bacon, sagaciously guessed that
heat is an expansive motion of particles; but he
regarded heat and cold as two contrary principles.
Almost in the same generation the brilliant John
Mayow perceived a substance in the air &#8220;allied
to saltpetre,&#8221; which passed in and out of the blood
by the way of the lungs or placenta. &#8220;Innate heat&#8221;
then gave way to phlogiston; but it was not till
the discovery of oxygen and of the conservation
of energy that we attained a theory of energy, and
finally got rid of &#8220;matter and form,&#8221; and of all the
thicket of metaphysics, relating thereto; through
which in the day of Harvey no mind, however
mighty, could have made its way.</p>

<p>In the history of medieval thought we must
always bear in mind that in neither of its two periods
were theology, logic, metaphysics, psychology, or
even physics, fully differentiated; and before the
Arabian literature they were not differentiated at
all<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>. Logic, which for us is but a drill, and, like all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>drills, a little out of fashion, was for the Middle Ages
a means of discovery, nay, the very source of truth;
thus every man carried his own busy laboratory
within him. The heirs of Porphyry and Boetius
had no other method in their possession. The
dialectically irresistible was the true (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8049;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962;);
thus was man to succeed &#8220;irrefutabile aperire
secretum.&#8221; To begin to think before beginning
to learn is a hollow business, yet then logic
furnished the theorems which experience might
illustrate at its leisure; and nature was contemplated
under philosophy. The differentiation of
psychology began with the translation of the <i>De
anima</i><a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>, and the recognition of the relation of the
percipient; hence, in the second period, Roger
Bacon denounced the pretensions of logic, and John
Duns, that brilliant backslider, forced them to an
absurdity. Again, on the translation of the Metaphysics,
theology parted into the studies of the
doctrines of God and the soul, which belong to
theology proper, and of being, in modes, kinds and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>universals, which belong to metaphysics. Medicine
again was a confusion of spheres, as was theology;
the care of the soul and the care of the body were
the ends of knowledge, and their means contained
all knowledge. Thus when we hear that Alcuin
ordered the formal teaching of medicine, it was
under the name of &#8220;Physica&#8221;; and not until the
Physics of Aristotle came to light did the various
branches of natural history become in their turn
not only definite studies but also self-sufficient,
aside from the art of healing. To this day the
healer keeps the name of &#8220;physician&#8221;; and the
subject at Cambridge the name of Physic. It is
well to be reminded that although the soldiers of
truth must be separated into several regiments,
nevertheless for its edification the healing art
must draw, directly or indirectly, on all natural
science. Robert of Lincoln, Albert of Cologne,
and all the Masters of that time studied medicine&mdash;that
is &#964;&#8048; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8049;&mdash;as a solid part of knowledge,
which in their apprehension was not only a whole
but also a manageable whole. Even Francis Bacon
did not realise fully the littleness of man in the
presence of nature; he hoped that for his harvest
man would on a right method&mdash;by, let us say,
a reformed astrology and a reformed alchemy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>quickly
surprise the secret of her processes: thus
Bacon was the last of the Summists. With the
differentiation of the several spheres of knowledge,
and the perception of the vastness and variety of
each, man has ceased to hold not the unity but
the simplicity of nature; and he has given up
summaries: the theologian rules no longer in
metaphysics and psychology; the physician is no
longer the only naturalist.</p>

<p>Systems succeed each other but give each other
the hand; it takes many a generation to kill a strong
theory outright: realism, shaken by Roscellinus and
Ab&eacute;lard, and scotched by Hales and Ockham, survived
to mislead Harvey; and still it stretches its
withered hand over us in the nursery, in the school,
and in the great arguments of life<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>. Malebranche
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>warned us against our deceptive terminology. &#8220;Ils
pr&eacute;tendent expliquer, (he says), la nature par
leurs id&eacute;es g&eacute;n&eacute;rales et abstraites, comme si la
nature &eacute;tait abstraite.&#8221; The methods of the
English grammar schools are even now medieval
in so far as their teaching begins, as it mostly
does still, with abstract propositions.</p>

<p>Mysticism gathered over Germany; in Paris to
this day nature is constrained in the artifices of
logic and rhetoric; and to this day platonism,
chiefly by the influence of the Florentine humanists
and perhaps of the Cambridge school of Henry
More, has moulded both thought and language
in England. John Hunter conceived a &#8220;materia
vit&aelig; diffusa&#8221;; and but yesterday Huxley had to
say of Owen&#8217;s theory of &#8220;spermatic force&#8221; that
an artillerist might as well attribute the propulsion
of a bullet to &#8220;trigger force.&#8221; We profess
Aristotle, and we talk Plato. Even by men of
science it is daily forgotten that the only being is
the particular. After the Faith then, realism&mdash;the
belief in principles and kinds having external
existence, and in formative essences to be reached
by abstract thinking&mdash;stood another adversary
against natural knowledge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>But, stronger even than realism, was a third
adversity&mdash;the pride of the human mind. Socrates,
although, for ethics and politics, he initiated the
inductive method, was disposed to regard physical
speculations as but a rational pastime<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>, and the
political and ethical study of man as the only
serious engagement of thought. Aristotle took
up natural knowledge as an encyclopedist<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>; he
rarely verified his facts and he made no experimental
researches<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>. The medieval church held
that &#8220;ex puris naturalibus cognoscere&#8221; was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>meagre and might be a mischievous amusement;
and it sought to confine speculations to final
causes, that is to the animation of the world
by an intelligent Being, as man animates his
own instruments: though, as Roger Bacon declared,
final causes must have physical means.
Even Locke thought nature to be hopelessly complex,
and urged that ethics is the proper study of
man. The asceticism derived from the East, disdainful
of carnal things, brought the dualism of
matter and spirit into monstrous eminence; and,
in respect of medicine, in a few generations it
turned the cleanest people in the world into the
most filthy<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>. Moreover, are we not bound to admit
that, as ultimate analysis was dangerous to the
synthesis of the Faith, so for unwieldy and unstable
societies in which ethical and political
habits had not yet become engrained, to descend
from transcendental explanations to explanations
by lower categories was fraught with some danger
to lofty and imposing standards of custom and
conduct? Nature is too base, says St Anselm,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>for us to argue from it to God; we must
argue from God to things. Analysis is a disintegrating
function; the departure of the scientific
enquirer is rather from below upwards: it is not
only his bias but also his deliberate method to
decline to use the discipline and the conceptions
of higher categories until he is satisfied that those
of the lower are inadequate. A certain natural
process may not be attributed to those of chemistry
until those of physics are proved to be inadequate;
to another process biological conceptions and
methods are denied until those of physics first,
and then of chemistry, have been tried and found
wanting; psychological conceptions are denied to
another until in their turns the physical, the
chemical, and the physiological are exhausted<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>;
and so on: and within each category the same
economy prevails. Now this scientific economy,
perhaps first formulated, or effectively used, by
William Ockham, in the phrase &#8220;entia non sunt
multiplicanda&#8221;&mdash;known as &#8220;Ockham&#8217;s rasor&#8221;&mdash;is
what is called now-a-days &#8220;materialism&#8221;; and
there is no doubt that the method, legitimate, nay,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>imperative, as it is in natural science, may in
custom and conduct engender a personal and
collective habit of apprehending in lower categories,
and even of contentment in them until
strong reason be shown to go higher<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>. A higher
order of ideas is put in a lower order of language;
the &#8220;&#8001;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#8049;&#964;&#969;&#8221; of Heraclitus. The danger
of this attitude lies in loss of effort, of aspiration,
and even of imagination; he must stoop on the
weary oar who, knowing no anchorage, is ever stemming
the drift. Notwithstanding is there in history
any lesson sadder than this, that where ideals have
been loftiest sin and failure have most abounded?
a lesson from which Carlyle learned that &#8220;the ideal
has always to grow in the real, and often to seek
out its bed and board there in a very sorry way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost to this day then the mechanical arts,
presumably concerned rather with the lower categories,
have been regarded as base; and the craft
even of the laboratory as unworthy of great souls.
Anatomy had to labour against antipathy both ecclesiastical
and popular; chemistry and mechanics were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>gross pursuits, unless endowed with the perilous
distinctions of alchemy and sorcery. Unfortunately
this charge upon the dignity of man was made
heavier rather than lighter by Petrarch, and by the
later humanists of the Renascence; even in the 17th
century we find in Oxford that Boyle was bantered
by his friends as one &#8220;given up to base and
mechanical pursuits.&#8221; As Boyle himself put it
in his delightful way&mdash;&#8220;There are many Learned
Men ... who are apt to repine when they see any
Person capable of succeeding in the Study of solid
Philosophy, addicting himself to an Art (Chemistry)
they judge so much below a Philosopher, and so
unserviceable to him. Nay, there are some that
are troubled when they see a Man acquainted
with other Learning countenance by his example
sooty Empiricks&#8221; ... &#8220;whose Experiments may
indeed be useful to Apothecaries, and perhaps to
Physicians, but are useless to a Philosopher that
aims at curing no Disease but that of Ignorance.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who early in the seventeenth
century attended lectures at Padua, opined
that natural science deals with &#8220;ignoble studies,
not proportioned to the dignity of our Souls.&#8221;
In the eighteenth century indeed, grave English
physicians, humanists who forgot how Aristotle had
exclaimed that marvellousness lies in all natural
phenomena, scorned the trivial curiosity of John
Hunter respecting flies and tadpoles.</p>

<p>It is part of my argument to-day to point out
one evil of many which this prejudice has wrought
for medicine. The progress of an applied science
dependent as it is upon accessions of advantage
from other arts, yet on the whole is from the
simple to the complex; from facts of more direct
observation to those of longer inference: and this
path was the more necessary when the right method
of inference&mdash;the so-called inductive method&mdash;had
not been formulated, and indeed was barely in use.
Now in medicine, from Homer to Lord Lister,
direct observation and the simpler means of experiment
have obtained their first-fruits on the
surface of the body. In Homeric times surgery
was the institution of medicine, and kings con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>cerned
themselves with the practice of it. From
Erasistratus to Celsus physicians of all schools
practised medicine and surgery as one art. Galen
urges the unity of medicine, and Littr&eacute; points out
that this unity is maintained in the Hippocratic
writings. In the Middle Ages the ascetic contempt
for the body&mdash;partly Stoic, chiefly oriental,&mdash;the
barren alliance of medicine with philosophy, and
the low esteem of mechanical callings hid from the
physician the very gates of the city into which he
would enter. Francis Bacon says of the physicians
of Harvey&#8217;s day, that they saw things from
afar off, as if from a high tower; and, again, that
after the manner of spiders they spun webs of sophistical
speculation from their own bowels. Surgery, by
virtue of its imperative methods, was kept clear of
philosophy on the one hand and of humanism on the
other; and in Paris the establishment of the Coll&egrave;ge
de St C&ocirc;me, afterwards the Academy of Surgery,
protected the higher surgery against the rabble
of barbers. Upon the raft of anatomy and surgery,
with some clinical aid from Salerno, positive
medicine crossed the gulf between Byzantine
compilations, monkish leechcraft, Arab starcraft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
and alchemy, and the scientific era of Harvey<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>.
But physicians were not only blind to the great
services to the whole art of medicine of the surgical
school of Lanfranc in the fourteenth century, of Guy
de Chauliac in the fifteenth, and of Par&eacute; and Gale
in the sixteenth century, advances even accelerated
in the seventeenth, but they ignored also their
very origin, and even withdrew from fellowship
with the surgeon; to our grievous harm from
those days unto our own<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>. Surgery was excluded
from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>Paris; and from the Royal College of Physicians of
England, which was, and is still, enabled by charter
to teach surgery, and to grant licenses therein.
Fabricius, the master of Harvey, was fortunately as
great a surgeon as anatomist, and such was Fallopius.
In this College Harvey lectured on anatomy
and surgery, and he left his surgical instruments
to us; for us Caldwal founded a lectureship in
surgery which has been allowed virtually to lapse.
From the progress of anatomy which, under the
protection of the Italian nobles as formerly of the
Alexandrian, went hand in hand with surgery,
physicians drew then little advantage; and so in
part perhaps it came about that although Vesalius,
Fallopius, and Fabricius broke up the traditional
anatomy of Mundinus, yet anatomy did more even
for the fine arts than for physiology; and medicine
at the end of the Middle Ages had not recovered
the standard of Alexandria. Against this adversity
also had to contend the founder of physiology
whom to-day we celebrate.</p>

<p>Such were the chief adversities (vid. Appendix
on Astrology) under which the naturalist suffered,
but natural knowledge was never stifled; let us
now turn our eyes to another point of view, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the oppression to the gradual enfranchisement of
knowledge.</p>

<p>Necessary for the welding of western society
in the Middle Ages as was authority in all spheres
of thought and action, and, heavy as the price of
its inertia has been since its work was done, yet in
the celebration of the founders of natural science
it would be untrue to assume that before them,
even in the earlier scholastic period, the indomitable
spirit of man had lain under tyranny in silence.
&#8220;&#924;&#8051;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8055;&#8115; &#960;&#949;&#961; &#7952;&#957; &#966;&#961;&#949;&#957;&#8055;.&#8221; The way had
been prepared for them. By the Crusades of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries fury and devastation
were diverted in part from Europe, and
hurled upon Asia; which soon closes up again.
The na&iuml;ve serenity of the Faith was gone, but
as its great minsters arose it forgot its dangers;
and the social bonds of orthodoxy rudely shaken
were renewed. The Schools grew as great as the
churches: Naples, Pavia, Bologna and Padua;
Paris, Orleans, Bourges, Toulouse, Montpellier,
the Sorbonne; Oxford and Cambridge. Even the
Friars Preachers and Minors were driven to fight
with the new weapons; first rivalling the universities,
then possessing themselves of their chairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
But philosophy, which had lent much to the Faith<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>,
gained nothing from it; and to philosophy rather
than to the Church the sciences looked for their
principles and methods. In physics the experimental
method was creeping into life; and the
substance as well as the form of old controversies
was changing. Thus through all these generations
was rising a leaven of free thought, and its reforms
may roughly be put in a twofold division, into the
reform of tradition, and the reform of method;
the reform of texts being again divisible into two
periods&mdash;the Arabian, or second scholastic, and
the modern or Renascence period. The chief
monuments of learning were stored in Byzantium<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
until Western Europe was fit to take care of them.
In the peace of Theodoric, in the peace of Charlemagne,
under Alfred at Winchester, the arts and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>sciences had scarcely found breathing-time, and
no sure establishment<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>. Cassiodorus is said to
have directed the Benedictines of the sixth century
to read C&aelig;lius Aurelianus, a Roman adaptor of
Soranus of Ephesus; but medical lore consisted of
little beyond some relics of the Roman schools,
handed on in prose or verse compilations which the
teacher read to his class, and explained so far as
he could. It seems that medicine was not taught
formally until so ordered, in 805, by Charlemagne;
probably by the advice of Alcuin, the founder of
the learned tradition at Fulda, the founder, we may
almost say, of the neo-latin period, and some time
headmaster of my own school of St Peter at
York. The influence of the School of Salerno,
relatively excellent as it was in the domains
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>of clinical medicine and of public health, never
made its way into the general stream of Western
culture. Religious wars and persecutions had driven
Greek learning eastwards, as in the case of the
Nestorians from Antioch to Persia; Hebrew and
Syrian sages<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> translated some classical texts, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>from these again the Arabs, in their brief and
brilliant culture, made translations; for no Arab
sage knew Greek. The palace of the Spanish
Caliphs in the tenth century was a workshop of
translators, and a huge storehouse of books. The
learned and ubiquitous Jew carried texts and
translations from Bagdad to Morocco, and from
Morocco to Toledo, Paris, Oxford and Cologne; but
translations made in Bagdad in the ninth century
did not reach Paris till the eleventh or twelfth.</p>

<p>Among the earliest of these renderings in the
West were works on medicine, mathematics, and
astronomy, which in the Schools of Toledo and
Cordova, by Constantinus Africanus at Monte
Cassino (including certain treatises of Hippocrates
and Galen), by Gerard of Cremona (a Salernitan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>scholar), by Michael the wizard<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>, and by other hands,
were converted into Latin; and, thus doubly disguised,
and half buried in glosses which not only
overlaid the text (&#8220;oscura glossa dov&#8217; &eacute; piana la
lettera&#8221;) but often supplanted it, were received with
pathetic eagerness by the ardent scholars of the
West. Aristotle, for instance, was now taught in
the schools of the West from a Latin translation
of a Hebrew translation of an Arab commentary
upon an Arab translation of a Syriac translation
of the Greek text<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>. Even in the sixteenth century
medicine and anatomy were taught wholly from
books; and teachers were forbidden to use other
than prescribed books. Students began with the
&#8220;Articella&#8221; of the Venetian physician Gregorio
Volpi, a compendium of translations with wood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>cuts,
published in 1491; they advanced to the
Aphorisms, the Diet in Acute Diseases and the
Prognostics of Hippocrates, overlaid with Syriac,
Arabic and Spanish apparatus and glosses; to the
Ars Parva of Galen; to the first and fifth Canons of
Avicenna, with glosses; to the <span class="smcap">ix</span>th Book of Rhazes,
Honein, Aegidius Corboliensis, and perhaps some of
the translations of Constantinus Africanus<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>;&mdash;this
was the lore that ruled the medical schools even to
the birth of Harvey. Disputations among the students
were incessant, both &#8220;inter se&#8221; and &#8220;sub cathedr&acirc;&#8221;;
but it is doubtful whether these did more than
sharpen their dialectical wits. Botany, regarded
by the galenists as the secret of the divine dispensary,
was always more forward; every medical
school had its physic garden, professors carried
their students abroad to gather herbs, and Herbals,
Dispensatoriums and Kr&auml;uterb&uuml;cher were much in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>advance of the Bestiaries, mostly after Pliny&#8217;s kind,
the chief of which, largely an original work, was
that of the well-known Conrad Gesner.</p>

<p>Some hundred years before the appearance of
the Arabian Aristotle, which marked the second
scholastic period, we have seen that the shadow of
the Faith and the savagery of the peoples had not
quelled such teachers as Roscellinus and Ab&eacute;lard,
who fought for rationalism so sturdily as even then
to threaten the ascendency of realism and the
persuasion of supple and plausible demagogues
like Anselm of Laon&mdash;that &#8220;sterile tree&#8221; as
Ab&eacute;lard called him,&mdash;and actually to determine
the first period of the Middle Ages. Happily
the Arabian scholastic philosophy took its root
in Alexandria when neo-platonism had veered
towards Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>, and it was more uniformly
peripatetic than the earliest Christian Scholasticism.
It is one of the notes of the greatness
of Aristotle that, even thus garbled and glossed,
his power made itself felt by the mouths of the
great Franciscans Alexander Hales, Roger Bacon,
and William Ockham. The Organon had been
expounded in Paris in 1180, and about the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>time Alexander Neckam cited the Posterior Analytics,
the Topics and the <i>De anima</i>; but Hales
was in possession of the whole, or almost the
whole, of a more or less corrupt Aristotle, which
he turned upon theology.</p>

<p>Roger Bacon was the first of the natural philosophers
of the West, and the only eminent forerunner
of Harvey and the other pioneers of natural
science in the seventeenth century. As erudite as
Albert, Bacon was more inventive, freer of spirit,
more disposed to scientific method, better aware of
the hollowness of authority, better aware that truth
can be found only in free reason guided by experiment.
Unfortunately as an author he was as dull
and ineffectual as Francis Bacon was rich, animated
and impressive. That indeed this premature
renascence, without scientific methods or sound
tradition, should have failed<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>, that its light
was but the phantom of dawn<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>, is no matter
for surprise; yet from this time forward the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>methods of Cyprian and Athanasius lost their
undisputed sway. This earlier renascence made
the second period of the Middle Ages: the
period distinguished by the Arabian version of
Aristotle; by a check to the chimeras of realism;
by some liberty of secular knowledge, for even
bishops came out of the Mussulman school of
Toledo and arrayed themselves in vestments of
Arab work decorated with sentences from the
Koran; and again by the coming of the friars,
the Dominican and Franciscan especially, whose
influence upon the thought of the Middle Ages
was considerable, and soon rivalled even that of
the universities, wherein later, as we have seen,
they filled some of the chairs.</p>

<p>The issues of all schemes of thought led indeed
as inevitably to natural science, as all ways to Rome.
The logic and rhetoric of the learned Dominicans&mdash;the
watch-dogs (&#8220;Domine cani&#8221;) of the Lord against
the wolves of heresy,&mdash;culminating in the systems
of Albert and St Thomas, by their rationalism
defined, and in defining restricted, the dominion
of the Faith. Keen defenders of the Faith recognised
this danger, and whimpered even against
Albert that &#8220;philosophiam profanam in limen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Sanct&aelig; Theologi&aelig; intromiserit; ... in ipsa sacraria
Christi<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>.&#8221; Men got used to reason, and great protestants,
such as Robert of Lincoln, had put justice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>and honour before ecclesiastical politics<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>. Then
the few Greek texts found their way into the West,
and in the thirteenth century Albert and Aquinas
possessed themselves of Greco-latin translations of
some treatises of Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>. And in the history
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>of the comparatively unlearned Friars Minors we
find, as elsewhere in the history of thought, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>mysticism was less unfavourable to natural science
than the passionate dogmatism of Clairvaux, or
the dogmatism by ratiocination of St Thomas; the
Victorians, as Gerson after them, despised reason
rather than feared it; they would not accept the
services of philosophy even with its wings clipped.</p>

<p>Mysticism makes for individual religion, as with
Glisson and Newton, rather than for a Church,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>as Albert was clear-sighted enough to foresee; if
science undermines dogma, mysticism relaxes or
neglects it: hence, as clerks only could teach, it
may have been that independent thinkers like
Hales, Roger Bacon, and Ockham entered the Franciscan
order<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>. Indeed the science of Pietro di Abano
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>(1250-1320), which laid the foundations of medicine
at Padua, and inspired the frescoes of the
Salla della Ragione, was occult and mystical.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>
<p>In the thirteenth century then the conflict with
the provisional synthesis of the Faith had become
imminent and menacing. The faith, the chivalry
and the learning of the Saracens led men to feel
that without the Church all might not be utter
darkness. Albert owed as much to Avicenna<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>&mdash;&#8220;the
 Albert of the Orient&#8221;&mdash;as St Thomas to
Averroes; pagan sages technically damnable yet
&#8220;mighty spirits,&#8221; worthy of reverence. Dante put
in Hell, but on green meadows in an open place,
lofty and luminous,&mdash;esteeming himself exalted by
the sight of them,&mdash;not only Aristotle, Plato and
Socrates, but also</p>

<p>Universities were founded in France, England, and
Italy. Frederick the Second protected the Arabs,
and even aped them; Ghibeline indeed almost
signified freethinker. From the Roman de Renard,
from the candid Joinville, from Boccaccio, we may
infer that the very foundations of the Faith were
sapped; and therewith, for good or ill, both moral
and political bonds were loosened. But the natural
Science which made the second renascence irresistible
was absent in the first: the consolidation
of the European peoples was not compact
enough for a rehandling of the conceptions of
religion and morals, too incomplete even for
the latitude of opinion which, in nations as in
individuals, is apt to slacken swift and consentient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
action. The toleration and scepticism of the first
renascence had causes no deeper than a general
enlargement of experience and thought.</p>

<p>To appreciate the influence, covert or overt, of
scepticism in the Middle Ages we must clear the
meaning of the word. Under the yoke of tribal
custom scepticism can hardly arise, there is no
place for the half-hearted, as all men feel alike
so all think alike: scepticism arises when beliefs
are put into formal propositions. Then, as experience
and comparison enlarge, we detect scepticism
in three forms or degrees: namely, doubt of a particular
creed; doubt of all unverified propositions;
and doubt of the validity of reason itself, whether in
respect of the supernatural only or of all argument.
It is remarkable that this last, the most devastating
of the forms of scepticism, has come from the ranks
of the faithful (Pascal, Hamilton, Mansel), who in
resentment of the attacks of reason have turned
blindly to rend reason herself. No civil society
has been without scepticism; even in ages of most
prevalent faith some current of doubt has flowed
under the surface. In the Ionian philosophy the
place of scepticism was only restricted in so far as
many aspects of the subject-matter were not before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
those thinkers; for instance no Greek philosopher
would have separated faith from reason. In the
well-known words of Hippocrates, &#8220;&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;
&#7953;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#965; &#952;&#949;&#953;&#8057;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#945;.&#8221;
&#8220;The Greek boldly set up his academy by the
side of the temple.&#8221; Even Protagoras never taught
the futility of all reason, nor even the inconstancy
of sensation which indeed is doctrine rather than
scepticism. Neo-platonism had its scepticism in the
first two forms, covering even the ground of the
modern agnostic. Agnosticism does not deny the
existence of the ladder, but asserts that the ladder
begins and ends in the clouds; it is consistent therefore
with ethical and practical activity. When
Ab&eacute;lard said &#8220;Dubitando enim ad inquisitionem
venimus, inquirendo veritatem percipimus,&#8221; if a
sceptic, he was no infidel. Even in the thirteenth
century it was never doubted that truth is attainable,
nor indeed that the Faith contained the truth.
The scepticism of that age was rather cautious and
controversial than faithless, and in practice divine
discontent rather than indifference (&#7936;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#8055;&#945;).
Pyrrhonism on the other hand leads to slackness
of ethics; either to the insouciance of Horace and
Montaigne, or to the attitude of the seventeenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
century in Padua (Pomponatius) and elsewhere,
when the &#8220;economy,&#8221; ironic or disingenuous, of
allotting their several spheres to reason and
dogma, if not first invented, became as fashionable
as in the pulpits and in the drawing-rooms
of Mayfair. &#8220;Comme savant j&#8217;ignore tout;
comme citoyen je crois tout.&#8221; The <i>Hypotyposes
Pyrrhoni&oelig;</i> of Sextus Empiricus, whose influence
in the times of the Renascence was considerable,
was not translated till the fourteenth century. The
detachment of mind and shrewd wisdom of John
of Salisbury foreshadowed Petrarch rather than
Hume; and when John discusses what it is given
to man to know, asking the frequent question,
&#8220;Utrum contingat homini scire aliquid?&#8221;, we must
not fall into the error of importing into his question
all it connotes for ourselves. Likewise when James
of Douay (in <span class="smcap">ms.</span> <i>De anima</i>, quoted by Haur&eacute;au)
roundly says, &#8220;Id quod recipitur ab aliquo non
recipitur secundum naturam rei recept&aelig; sed secundum
naturam recipientis ... sicut recipitur ita patitur....
Sensus judicando de sua passione non decipitur&#8221;
and so on, he knew no more whither this would lead
than John Duns knew that his system must lead
to that of Spinoza. That guardians of morals and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
social cohesion, from Cato to the Westminster
Assembly, and from Samuel Johnson to Cardinal
Newman, should have distrusted scepticism even as
reserve of judgment, or indeed repelled it with fierceness;
that priest, presbyter, magistrate and moralist
have tolerated irony, or even license, rather than
vigilant and radical criticism of doctrine, is intelligible;
and within limits springs from a justifiable
apprehension. For the gay and indolent sceptic
veers to conformity, especially if he mistrust the
competence of reason; while the active sceptic
endangers the theory of his society, and of the
sanctions upon which all moral conduct temporarily
depends. Hence the bitter condemnation of Galileo,
&#8220;Perish all physical science rather than one article
of the Faith be lost.&#8221; Happily it is true that during
times of transition piety and good conduct survive
by virtue of &#8220;inertia,&#8221; that is by tradition, social
pressure, custom and sense of fitness; and it is
true that in times of transition, as in our own
times, halting thought is quickened for a while by
plenitude of emotion, and wealth of &aelig;sthetic
impressions makes amends for poverty of ideas;
yet that morals are based on a theory of life is a
truth still deeper and more abiding, and this deeper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
truth it was the function of the &#8220;Ages of Faith&#8221;
to root in the conscience of mankind. &#8220;Abeunt
studia in mores.&#8221; As contrasted with Pyrrhonism,
scepticism in its normal sense, while it declares
that the conformity of notions with things in
themselves cannot be postulated, for lack of an
external standpoint of comparison, and while it
declines to be confuted by the &#8220;regressus ad infinitum,&#8221;
for, having repudiated first principles it
is prepared to be pushed backwards to remoter
and remoter causes, is ready nevertheless to yield to
assurance as facts are intercalated into inferences,
and as inferences thus stiffened by verification are
found to consist with each other and with the
general context of experience.</p>

<p>If in the Middle Ages these various attitudes of
mind were not fully distinguished, yet scepticism
was moving variably towards the demand for verification
on which all natural science is based; and
the reaction was not long delayed. In the thirteenth
century the culture of Omeyad and Abasid caliphs
failed; by the end of the century philosophy was
denounced and its books were burned; the generous
and learned Frederick dashed himself in vain
against the Papacy; Clement, the protector of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Bacon, was dead, and during the two following
centuries, in Spain at any rate, freedom of thought
was crushed out by the Church. In the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries the very name of Averroes&mdash;of
&#8220;the mad dog who barked against the Christ,&#8221;
the &#8220;Averroem impium &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#961;&#8054;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8049;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#8221; of
Erasmus&mdash;began to signify loose life as well as free
thought. Of this resentment there had been no
trace in Albert or St Thomas; but Imola had begun
to wonder why Dante had treated so well Averroes
who, if the Great Commentator, was yet the father
of infidels. The Dominicans controlled the fine
arts, and for them,&mdash;at Pisa, at Siena, in the
Spanish Chapel,&mdash;Orcagna, Gaddi, Spinello Aretino,
Simone Memmi abased the Empire, Averroes, and
the new learning far more intolerantly than Dante
had done; and exalted the Pope, with his handmaids
Theology, Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric.
In Santa Maria Novella, Memmi represents the
triumph of the Dominicans in theology, Gaddi in
philosophy; St Thomas and the Dominicans march
triumphant over Arius, Sabellius, Averroes, and
Savonarola. Thus in the Middle Ages Averroes
appeared in two forms&mdash;first as the Great Commentator,
later as the blasphemer and father of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
infidels of the Campo Santo and of Santa Maria
Novella. In the fifteenth century the Council of
Constance forbad the laity to teach, under a penalty
of forty days&#8217; excommunication. In the sixteenth,
in Granada, Ximenes burnt, it is said, 80,000 books
of Arab philosophy, as Torquemada did for Hebrew
in Seville; medical works, however, such as the
Colliget<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> of Averroes, and his Commentary on
Galen, were spared.</p>

<p>With the greater renascence the second period
of Scholasticism, and indeed the Middle Ages
themselves are closed. With the fall of Constantinople
the stream of learning, driven eastwards in
the first period of the Middle Ages, set westward
again. Exiled grammarians now found their shelter
under the protection of the &#8220;literate tyrants&#8221; of
Italy, and with their spoil of manuscripts enriched
the libraries of Rome and Venice. The Universities
of Bologna and Padua from their foundation
became notable for independence of thought; and,
on the revival of learning, for their peripatetic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>teaching as opposed to the platonism of Florence,
where, however, a spirit of accurate learning was
nurtured in the deciphering and verification of
texts. The political and commercial ambition of
Venice, the Holland of Italy, of which State Padua
was the learned quarter, and the inflow of liberal
thinkers from other nations, kept her aloof from
the fury of the Catholic reaction of the sixteenth
century, which ruined Paris; thus in North-east
Italy the spirit of modern science awoke sooner
than in England or in France, and inquisitive
students, both home and foreign, were attracted
rather to Padua and to Bologna than, as in earlier
times, to Paris.</p>

<p>In so far as Scholasticism may be described as
a temporary reconciliation of Aristotle&mdash;that is, of
natural and secular methods&mdash;with the Faith, this
end had been attained, if at all, by St Thomas; in
St Thomas Scholasticism culminated. But no such
artificial truce could abide; and the issue of the
chief scholastic controversy was to be determined by
one greater than St Thomas. The pilgrim to Ockham,
sitting in its church beneath the seven lancets of
its twelfth century window, may be solitary also in
his memory of one of the greatest of Englishmen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
who saw that light six long centuries ago; yet a
child rather of our age than of his own. As
Ab&eacute;lard had closed the gates upon the neo-platonist
tradition of Alexandria, so Ockham closed them
against realism in all its forms; and the Church
cursed them both. In his own person the occupation
of professorial chairs by Franciscans came to
an end; Paris and the Thomists could not consistently
oppose nominalism; Duns the Northumbrian
had inflated realism into a monstrous
phantasm, and speculative reason had to submit
to the yoke of verification. Yet what could
nominalism do for theology, or for clerical schools?
The Franciscans for the most part had turned to
mysticism, and thenceforth the man of science and
the devotee were to work apart. Furthermore, by
Ockham philosophy gained a new meaning, or lost
all meaning. Before Locke, Voltaire, and Kant,
Ockham demonstrated that faculties were not
substances; and differentiated logic, psychology,
and natural science<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>.</p>

<p>But if, as I have said, the way for Harvey and
the other pioneers of natural knowledge was thus
prepared for them, it was still, even in the seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>teenth
century, dark, rough and perilous. As in
all times of transition, still the weight of defunct
systems rolled inertly along; and while the new
forces seemed to slumber stresses were accumulating.
In Oxford and Cambridge the influence
of Linacre, and even of Caius<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>, seems to have been
rather humanist than scientific<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>; in Oxford the
text rather than the inspiration of Aristotle prevailed,
while in Cambridge the platonist school, of
which the charming Henry More was the leader,
full of inspiration as it was, soon evaporated into
mysticism, or obscurantism. Bacon and Harvey
seem to have left Cambridge&mdash;for Paris and
Padua respectively&mdash;as Locke left Oxford<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>, under
some discouragement. Of Paris the great days
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>were over; it was in Padua that medicine, long
degraded or disguised, was now to prove her
lineage as the mother of natural science, and
the truth of the saying of Hippocrates that to
know the nature of man one must know the nature
of all things. But on Harvey&#8217;s arrival, Padua,
which had become the first school of Medicine in
Europe, as was Bologna of Imperial Law<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>, was
settling down upon the lees of the once noble
school of Averroes: a discipline which, by its
original strength, by its freedom of thought, and
by the ascendency of its professors, had withstood
in the thirteenth century the direct condemnation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>of the brilliant fourth Lateran Council; and in the
sixteenth the thunders of Trent. Padua adopted
Averroism, in the fourteenth century, because of its
medical contents; in the two following centuries this
system was emptied of heart and life, but pattered
and mumbled by pretentious pedants in North-east
Italy it prevailed till the seventeenth, when after a
reign of three centuries it was succeeded by the
Cartesian. Of its phases in the sixteenth century
Patrizzi said, &#8220;Ingens ab his philosophorum numerus
ac successio manavit qu&aelig; in Aven Rois hypothesibus
habitavit.... Inde dubitationum ac qu&aelig;stionum
sexcentorum milium numerus manavit&#8221; (Disc.
Peripat. Vol. I. Venet. 1571; quoted by Renan,
Averro&egrave;s). The name of Averroes, &#8220;perfectus et
gloriosissimus physicus, veritatis amicus et defensor
intrepidus,&#8221; became the shibboleth of philosophers
who held the different nature of the heavenly
bodies against the &#8220;moderns&#8221; who alleged the
identity of matter in sky and earth, and the doctrine
of the universal against the individual soul.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of Petrarch&#8217;s gibes, Averroism in its
spring had nursed Padua with the milk of natural
science. Even in its decay&mdash;for all teaching of
philosophy, as a separate study, must decay&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
triumph of the Faith was premature; like Jansenism,
the School of Averroes, effete as it became, held the
ground for a more dangerous invasion, for Leonardo,
Telesio, Bruno, Gilbert, Sarpi, Campanella, Galileo,
and Harvey; for the pioneers of truth, not as
consistency with tradition, not as an alchemical
search for real essences, nor indeed as wisdom
only; but as the verification of premises. This fuse
Paracelsus fixed to the shell which burst upon
the Faith, upon Scholasticism, upon Galenism,
and even upon humanism, &#8220;So Christus spricht
&#8216;Perscrutamini scripturas&#8217;; warum soll ich nicht
sagen &#8216;Perscrutamini naturas rerum&#8217;?&#8221; The <i>Credo
ut intelligam</i> of Augustine and Anselm of Canterbury;
the <i>Intelligo ut credam</i> of Aquinas
belonged to the past; and men began to cry &#8220;c&#8217;est
Dieu qui nous veut h&eacute;r&eacute;tiques.&#8221; A criticism based
upon a larger sense of the relativity of knowledge,
and, in the sixteenth century, a new scepticism<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>,
which pierced even into the Vatican, as to the very
possibility of knowledge of the nature of being,
were preparing the way for new conceptions: but
in ethics meanwhile men were falling either into
the carelessness of the scoffer or into the anti-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>nomianism
of the mystic. The brilliant futilities
of the medieval dialectic had led to weariness
of spirit. After vain and vexatious jugglings with
the dry tissues of unchastened ratiocination, simplicity
and even ignorance brought their solace.</p>

<p>As from Florence humanism invaded English
letters, so the Averroistic physician of Padua
became known, even in Chaucer&#8217;s day, as a man
of secular rather than of Scriptural learning. In
Padua, while Galileo was teaching Euclid for a
pittance, chairs of Averroistic philosophy were
filled by highly paid professors, whose &#8220;rotuli&#8221; or
portfolios, many of which now rest in the dust of
the libraries of North Italy, were handed down
from one to another in deadly routine. Virtually,
however, the Averroistic tradition ended with a
contemporary Paduan professor, Cremonini, lifted
into fame by Harvey&#8217;s refutation in the <i>De motu
cordis</i>, and by his own repudiation of the satellites
of Jupiter, bodies for which Aristotle had
made no provision. The coarseness and pedantry
of the Averroistic freethinkers, whose scepticism
lacked the elegance and sprightliness of the French,
and their bastard language&mdash;mongrel of Greek
and Arabic&mdash;revolted the humanists also: &#8220;Nihil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
indoctius, nihil insulsius, frigidius.&#8221; &#8220;Unum te obsecro,&#8221;
Petrarch had said two hundred years before
(in his invectives against doctors, whom he classed
with astrologers, as afterwards indeed did Harvey
more or less), &#8220;ut ab omni consilio mearum rerum
tui isti Arabes arceantur atque exsulent.&#8221; &#8220;De
medicis non modo nil sperandum sed valde etiam
metuendum<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>.&#8221; The doctors in their turn did not hide
their disdain for poets. Whether justly or unjustly,
the Doctors of Medicine were classed with astrologers
and alchemists; the latter of whom Harvey
repudiated frankly, not altogether avoiding a contempt
for chemistry itself. Clad in fine raiment,
with rings on their fingers and golden spurs on
their heels, they rode tall horses, and gave themselves
pompous airs. The humanist would rather
pose as a believer than as an underbred infidel;
the Averroist protected the license of his doctrines
and manners by subterfuge and ironic evasion:
and humanist and Averroist alike stood by at the
burning of Bruno<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p><p>It must not be supposed, however, that these
pompous pedants had it all their own way, and that
Medicine was not better justified of her children.
It is full of interest for our present purpose to
read in the preface by Thomas Junta to the
Edition of Averroes (1552), &#8220;Plerique omnes
juniores medici jam intolerabile in Arabum Mauritaniorumque
dogmata odium conceperunt, ut ne
nominandi citandive locus relinquatur; principes
etiam Hippocratem atque Galenum habere nos
pr&aelig;dicant.&#8221; This enlightenment seems to have
come about in some part through the teaching of
Thom&aelig;us Nicolaus Leonicus<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>, who began to lecture,
for the first time, from the Greek text of Aristotle
(there were chairs thenceforth for both the Arabian
and the Greek Aristotle) in 1497.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>
<p>It was with Galileo however that scientific
research began in Padua, at any rate for professors;
and Galileo may be venerated as the first modern
naturalist to set the experimental method conceptually,
coherently, and thoroughly before himself,
including the deductive side of it. In the Harveian
Oration of 1892, Dr Bridges reminded us that
Galileo conceived of motion and energy as calculable
quantities, and drew our attention to
those most interesting experiments wherein Galileo
applied the pendulum to measure the rate and
rhythm of the pulse. Roger Bacon had dwelt
upon experiment, but scarcely upon methodical
verification thereby. The chemistry of Albert of
Cologne was but a return of the curiosity of
Geber of Cordova (in the ninth century). Even
Francis Bacon saw the method less clearly than
Galileo had done; and, as the last of the schoolmen
and encyclopedists, he made a place for it
rather in literature and philosophy: he ignored,
as the scientific Descartes welcomed, the cardinal
discoveries of Copernicus and of Harvey<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
But if Galileo discovered the experimental method
as a method, before Galileo the method was in
use. Leonardo had laid down the rule of investigation
of nature by experiment, and the aphorism
that nature never deceives us; unfortunately his
manuscripts were not published. In the first
half of the fifteenth century Nicholas of Cusa
weighed plants at definite stages of their growth
in known weights of earth; and he weighed
the moisture of the air. His contemporary Leon
Battista Alberti of Genoa had done likewise. But
above all the scientific forerunners of Galileo and
Harvey stands William Gilbert, Fellow of St John&#8217;s
College, Doctor of Medicine of Cambridge, Censor
and President of this College, Physician to Queen
Elizabeth, and Founder of the science of Magnetism.</p>

<p>The century dating from the birth of Galileo to
the death of Harvey was perhaps the most brilliant
in the history of modern knowledge. The discovery
of Greek texts had destroyed the conventional
Aristotle, the conventional Hippocrates and Galen;
since the latter part of the sixteenth century Greek
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>had been taught in the High Schools, philosophy
was born again, and men found themselves no
longer the slaves but the kin of the great
ancients. Telesius, Bruno, Campanella vindicated
natural science and liberty of thought. Galileo
taught in Padua for twenty years, including the
time when Harvey graduated there; Torricelli was
a pupil of the great Florentine; in 1582, on
the theory of Copernicus, Gregory reformed the
Calendar, and thus laid the axe to the root of
astrology; by Newton terrestrial physics were
established in the celestial spheres<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>. Malpighi,
who was to fulfil Harvey&#8217;s discovery and foresight,
was born in N.-E. Italy in the very year (1628) in
which the <i>De motu cordis</i> was published. In
1626 Boyle was creating chemistry. Anatomy,
which had slept since its days in Alexandria, was
fully awake. The Society of the Lincei was virtually
founded in 1603; the Royal Society<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> in 1645; the
Academy of France in 1656. Clinical teaching, initiated
in Salerno and advanced by the <i>Consilia</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span><i>medica</i><a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>, was formally established in Padua<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>, to be
pursued in Heidelberg, Leyden, and Vienna. Thus
was the study &#8220;De rerum natura juxta propria
principia&#8221; unfolded, and the &#8220;Civitas Dei&#8221; gave
place to the &#8220;Regnum Hominis.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Regnum Hominis&#8221;! Yet when I look,
from a respectful distance, upon the folios of the
schoolmen, monuments, I am told, as empty as the
Pyramids of Egypt, my mind turns back to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>fiery and turbulent tribes which in the &#8220;deep
but dazzling darkness&#8221; of the Middle Ages raged
upon a barren land before the nations began; and
I wonder if the ideas which awed them, swayed
them, and welded them into stable societies were
fancies as wild and sterile; and if the men who
wrought them were mere traffickers in words. And
then I wonder if we are glad that the riddle of the
origin and issues of being, which tormented their
eager hearts, is not solved, but proved insoluble:
if we are glad that &#8220;sub specie hominis&#8221; the earth,
no longer the nursery of eternal souls, is but a
meteor in the sky; men and women but the
gleam upon it; the sons of Heaven but companies
of whirling stones, and the Father of Heaven an
inaccessible idea.</p>

<p>The scholastic philosophies became inhuman only
in their decrepitude. In the equal eye of history,
the Middle Ages teach us that the slow and painful
travail of natural science is not to be regarded
as the belated labour of light in the womb of
darkness, nor as a mere stifling of the growth
of the human mind by tyranny and oppression,
nor indeed as the arming of moral forces against
brute forces, but as the condition of time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
in the making of societies on a necessarily
provisional theory of life. They teach us that
conduct in state and morals depends upon a
theory of life; that although habits and even
standards of ethics may abide for a time after the
theory on which they were built is sapped, it is but
for a time; that if the social discipline and fruition
are to be renewed and enlarged it must be upon
a new synthesis, as laborious and ardent as the
former, and more true. Meanwhile the business of
a nation, whether in war or peace, is first to be
quick and strong in action, to be rational afterwards;
and swiftness and strength come of union of
wills and singleness of heart rather than of wisdom.
Even within its borders freedom of opinion must
awaken slowly; the nation strong enough to suffer
irresolutions in its outward policy has yet to appear.
Hence it is that we find in ruling classes, and in
social circles which put on aristocratical fashions,
that ideas, and especially scientific ideas, are held
in sincere aversion and in simulated contempt.</p>

<p>The Greek was no heathen, suckled by nature
and endowed only with her instincts; he sought in
his mind to improve nature: but in the Renascence
instincts were set as free as thought. In this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
passionate and adventurous time to preach the destruction
of the animal instincts, or to crush them for
the higher life, was a noble idea, but an impossible
hope; the animal impulses are to be trained, not suppressed,
and for this the help of science was to come.
Yet science was to be not the hated rival but a
necessary ally of religion. It is not within the province
of science to answer the medieval searchings
on the nature of being, nevertheless this threshold
problem&mdash;&#8220;<i>der Drudenfuss auf der Schwelle</i>&#8221;&mdash;faces
us still; and the world, so far as we have
seen of it, has always demanded a provisional
answer. To-day Professor James Ward offers it
again in &#8220;Supreme Intelligence&#8221;; and Principal
Caird (&#8220;Fundamental Christianity&#8221;) yearns for
the knowledge of infinite being almost in the
words of Plato himself:&mdash;&#8220;If,&#8221; he cries, &#8220;underneath
all the phenomena of the world in which
we live we can discern no principle of reason
and order, no absolute intelligence and love, then
indeed&#8221; this world is a &#8220;meaningless waste.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilbert Galileo and Harvey, Maxwell Hertz
and Darwin have taught men not that the speculations
of the schoolmen were over-bold, for they
busied themselves with no speculations bolder or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
more transcendental than are our modern theories
on matter, on inertia, on the ether, or on the
origin of life, but that metaphysics by &#8220;intercalation
of facts&#8221; shall become physics, that, in the
words of Descartes, concepts, if &#8220;&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8048; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8049;,&#8221;
&#8220;talia sint tantum ut omnibus naturae ph&aelig;nomenis
accurate respondeant,&#8221; and that notions great and
small shall be subjected to strict verification, so far
as such tests can be carried; not that men shall
deny themselves the rapture of touching that
various instrument they find within themselves,
but that they shall endure the drudgery of
learning to play it in harmony with the orchestra
of nature; not that they shall desist from imagining,
but that before proclaiming hypotheses they
shall be compelled to the humble task of making
an infinite number of little piles of facts. The art
of experiment can grow only with the growth
of science itself; instruments of precision are not
provided till men feel the need of them. The
experimental verification of concepts is no mere
alternative path, no mere renunciation, but a new
birth; a birth into a dull and vexatious discipline
for the impatient Hegelian, whether of the thirteenth
or of the twentieth century, who believes that, as
mind is the product of evolution, and so the sum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and store of nature, &#8220;in dem Gedanken selbst das

<p>The genius and courage concerned in a particular
discovery or reform it were impossible to
estimate; there is no method of determining the
specific gravity of such adventures: moreover we are
now so well used to the lights, bells, and soundings
of the routes of scientific enquiry that it is hard for
us to realise the pain and peril of fogs and contrary
winds in voyages where were no such guides.
Indeed no exposition of defects of methods can
explain false habits of thought without a careful
estimate of historical causes also, in what we may
call the embryology of thought; for at no time
were right methods of thought wholly wanting, or
even wholly disregarded. But, as we approach
Harvey&#8217;s own time, if on the one hand I have
shown that Europe until he came was not ready
for him, on the other hand I trust I have made
it more easy to conceive the weight of the social
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>systems, opinions, and prejudices against which
his gigantic effort was made. For, brilliant as
was the promise of the Renascence, yet in the
time of Harvey, and in the generation immediately
before him, the decay of the scholastic methods
and the worldliness of the Church, which in the
first half of the sixteenth century had favoured
the advance of secular culture, had led to a reaction,
not against Luther only but also against
all liberal learning and science. In the Vatican,
in the Sorbonne, in the Consistory, and even in the
courts of justice it was proclaimed that as these
studies make government more difficult, it were ill
to encourage them! We have seen that the Faith,
though undermined and no longer catholic, was
aroused, and was terrible still; orthodoxy was
crushing free thought in Italy; Alva was in Flanders,
and had been visited by Catherine de Medici at
Bayonne; in France the ruthless religious wars
ended in the triumph of Rome; Europe was overrun
by Dominicans and Franciscans; Trent was
long pregnant with anathema. Contrary sects
alike defied liberal culture; and four years before
Harvey&#8217;s birth the wolf, hidden under another
cloak, had torn Servetus&mdash;Servetus who shared
with Colombo the honour of preparing the way for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
the founder of modern physiology. Even the
genial conformist of the world, after his manner
when he is scared, had turned brutal; he felt that
the old conceptions upon which society was built
for him, were suspected, and therewith society
itself beginning to crack and split, yet he did
not see that now by science only could society be
recreated.</p>

<p>In Italy the Cinque Cento had taken its birth
and nourishment chiefly from Latin sources and
tradition. It regarded symmetry of form and rhetorical
modes of passion; elegance was preferred to
matter, and style to knowledge. Such a culture had
not the seeds of life in it; in the middle of the
sixteenth century its enthusiasms waned, its philosophy
fell into routine, its style into mannerism;
but science, not philosophy, not the Faith, was
the heir of the Middle Ages. Science is not of
Latin but of Greek inheritance, its sources are
Greek; and with the westward swarm of the
Greeks their older boons of eloquence and beauty
were rivalled by their newer gifts of scholarship
and natural knowledge. In France the leaders of
this school were the Huguenots, the flower of
the nation; in the Catholic reaction of the sixteenth
century France scorched her own bloom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and Spain was blasted for ever. The humanists,
who at best were false friends of science and
medicine, were no longer powerful friends; their
noble rage was suppressed by chill penury, and
many of the most learned and zealous of them
were vagabonds in Europe. Rhetoric, fine art,
and even philosophy may flourish in slavery,
learning and science can breathe no air but that
of freedom; and freedom of learning was quenched
in the blood of the Massacre of St Bartholomew.
In 1540 had been founded the Society of Jesus,
which then as now used science and learning, not
as sources of truth or tests of conduct, but as
tactics; putting on indeed the habit of the scholar,
but only the more effectually to control research.
Two years later the Spanish Inquisition was set
up in Rome; and its shadow fell even over Venice,
which abased itself to the imprisonment of Bruno.
The great Venetian printers, some time reduced to
the publications of decadent Averroism (p. 97), to
avert bankruptcy had to print breviaries. Henry of
Navarre, deserting Du Plessis Mornay, D&#8217;Aubign&eacute;,
and De Thou, turned not only Roman Catholic but
also ultramontane; and, if with his accession the
Terror had ceased, social and political ostracisms,
tests, and disabilities stifled all generous culture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>The great University of Paris, which throughout
the Middle Ages had been the heart of
Christendom, the centre of its life and heat,
which in the fourteenth century was at its
splendid culmination, and which had meddled with
no feeble hand even in the State, was waning
even in the fifteenth century, when France was
devastated by war and rapine and her schools
were emptied. This University, which had savagely
condemned Joan of Arc, and sent Nicholas Midi to
preach a solemn sermon at the stake, &#8220;pro Joann&aelig;
salutari admonitione et populi &aelig;dificatione,&#8221; in the
sixteenth century came out of the religious wars
stripped of its endowments, and deserted by its
students; its curriculum was crassly conservative,
its philosophy buckram, its theology a petrifaction;
its forty colleges were closed, grass grew
in its courts, and its public disputations were
abased to the decorous apostasy of the freethinker.
Montpellier was dominated by realism (vitalism).
Francis Bacon had done better to have gone
with Harvey to Padua; almost in the year of
the publication of the <i>De motu cordis</i>, the Parliament
of Paris issued an edict that no teacher
should promulgate anything contrary to the accepted
doctrines of the ancients.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>Such was the check which, after the death of Leo
the Tenth, had befallen liberal studies: no Bembo
now secretly protected freethinkers; in Central
Europe the generous Maximilian the Second, who
died in 1576 while counselling tolerance in religion
to Henry the Third, was followed by reactionary
emperors. In England no doubt the sky was clearer;
in the Salamis of modern civilization the malign
pretensions of Philip were shattered, and the
&#8220;spacious times of Elizabeth&#8221; were glorious in
their outburst of freedom, adventure, and culture,
Medicine, however, sinking in the sixteenth century,
fell, in the seventeenth, into that reproach which
has become a byword. All superstition was not
within the Faith. When Harvey&#8217;s discovery,
like an earthquake, had broken up galenism
and other outworn sophistries, his masterly work
stood forth not only against long-winded dialectics
on ars sphygmica, critical days, coctions,
derivatives, revulsives, and like abstractions bequeathed
by realism and uncritical subservience to
texts, but also against a more lurid background
of folk superstitions&mdash;of vampires, witch-burning,
magic, cabbalism, astrology, alchemy, chiromancy,
and water-casting. For medicine, says Bacon, is
associated with charlatanry as Aesculapius with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Circe. In physics, terrestrial and celestial, Galileo,
persecuted as he was, had some current with him
and before him; Copernicus had preceded him,
Kepler was beside him: but in physiology the waters
had closed upon the path of Galen as upon the wake
of a great ship; the anatomists, themselves galenists,
had given Harvey little help; and the share of Servetus<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>,
Colombo, and Fabricius was but small in the
discovery of the central fact of the science, and of
the method which opened the way to Pecquet and
Aselli, to Glisson, to Steno, to Wharton and Willis,
to Haller and Bernard. Harvey&#8217;s discovery was
the first step to a transfiguration of medicine;
and though after Harvey there arose much false
physiology and therewith again great floods of
medical sophistry, yet from his time medicine has
had to reckon with physiology, the only source
of scientific nosology and therapeutics.</p>

<p>We celebrate the memory of great men in the
certain hope that in their children they will be
born again.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<h4>ASTROLOGY.</h4>

<p>Besides those greater preventions which lay in the
very structure and organised conceptions of society in
the Middle Ages, the student of natural science was
thwarted also by many lesser, which could not find
place in this oration. Among the chief of these was
judicial astrology, which supplanted and degraded the
art of medicine.</p>

<p>It is difficult to carry the imagination into a time
when the heavens were conceived as an animate and
divine being<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>, the heavenly bodies as active and intelligent
parts of it, and the whole set not in illimitable
space but around man and his home, and waiting upon
him (vid. p. 47); yet without such an effort we cannot
realise the ancient place and dominion of astrology. Such
a possession when in its strength must have enthralled
the human mind; and it abode tenaciously with the first
scientific conceptions of celestial phenomena, even in the
thoughts of the enlightened. Tycho Brahe, for many
years of his life, was an adept; and even Kepler saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>portents in the skies. When we read the doctrines of
Aristotle on the celestial beings, it is indeed somewhat
strange that upon him, upon Plato, and upon the Ionians,
the &#8220;judicia astrorum&#8221; had even less hold than the mythology:
so truly poised, even in the infancy of science,
were the cosmic speculations of this wonderful race.
The Romans by their Etruscan tradition held to astrology,
chiefly derived from Chaldea and Egypt, and by
them it was mixed with grosser folk magic; yet even in
Rome there were many to repudiate it, not only such
Grecian spirits as Cicero but also such Romans as
Juvenal; as in Harvey&#8217;s time it was assailed by the
irony of Pascal and of La Fontaine. Even in the twelfth
century John of Salisbury had not failed to turn his
light artillery upon astrology.</p>

<p>This art of forecast naturally attached itself closely
to that of medicine; and in its decrepitude still it clung
to medicine like a parasite. And as parasites in the field
of pathology, so astrology brought with it other noxious
superstitions and follies even worse than itself. In
England it survived till the witty attack of Swift killed
Partridge and astrology together; yet to this day many
of its notions are embedded in our common speech.</p>

<p>Ptolemy among his good services did one ill to
mankind by his <i>Tetrabiblon</i> or &#8220;Quadripertit,&#8221; an
astrological treatise which was current with the Almagest
in the Western Schools. This authoritative treatise,
together with the Aristotelian conception of the heavens,
gave to astrology the aspect of a regular science with
its own principles and methods; a science admired and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
even courted by princes. As Frederick the Second
and Charles the Fifth would learn of the stars the
moment to take the field against their foes, so the
medieval physician sought their countenance in the
letting of blood or in the exhibition of a clyster or emetic.
The Church, abhorring all concurrent dominion, and
justly abhorring this bondage of the judgment of God
and of the will of man, almost alone withstood the
astrologer. If the doctors of theology did not know how
to deny the power of the stars in the material cosmos,
they vehemently denied it in the world of the spirit.
&#8220;Et ideo pro certo tenendum est,&#8221; says Aquinas,
&#8220;grave peccatum esse circa ea qu&aelig; a voluntate hominis
dependent judiciis astrorum uti.&#8221; Of the priestly
assailants of astrology, the most attractive to us for
his wit, sagacity and sound knowledge, was Nicholas
Oresme, sometime Bishop of Lisieux (died 1382), translator
of the <i>Ethics</i> and other Aristotelian treatises, as he
is portrayed for us by Haur&eacute;au (<i>Dict. des Sciences philosophiques</i>,
art. Oresme) and M. Charles Jourdain. The
fun of the thing is that the outspoken Oresme was the
counsellor, the friend, and even the tutor of that notable
astrologer Charles the Fifth; a story as honourable to
the prince as to the subject. As Charles issued from
the chambers of his astrologers the discourses of Oresme
must have made him a little uncomfortable, especially
when Oresme records the misfortunes of astrologising
captains, such as Alphonso king of Castille, of whom,
says he, I have heard nothing notable except that he
cast horoscopes, was unfortunate in war, and neglected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
his kingdom; or such again as James the king of
Majorca, a passionate astrologer, who on the dictation
of the stars made a sortie against Peter of Aragon, and
never came back again. It is all very well, says Oresme,
for kings to know somewhat of the noble science of
astronomy, but they must be content to hear of it in
talk with sages, and not to spend upon the stars time
and care which they should devote to the interests of
their people. &#8220;Mesmement tele chose&#8221; (astrology, necromancy,
geomancy and &#8220;quelconques tels ars&#8221;) est plus
p&eacute;rilleuse &agrave; personnes d&#8217;estat, comme sont princes et
seigneurs ausquelz appartient le gouvernement publique.
Et pour ce ay je compos&eacute; ce
livret en fran&ccedil;ois afin que
gens lais le puissent entendre, desquels, si comme j&#8217;ay
entendu, plusieurs sont trop enclins &agrave; telles fatuit&eacute;s.
Et autres fois ay je escript en latin de ceste mati&egrave;re&#8221;
etc. In spite of the Bishop of Lisieux, astrology at the
end of the fourteenth century reached the summit of its
influence and popularity. In the course of his argument
Oresme gives an admirable account of the nature of
hallucination and the parts it may play in perverting
knowledge; not only so but he explains also the
fallibility of the normal senses in respect of organic
defects, of media, of false inference, of association, of
imposition of the imagination, and so forth. Under
such circumstances, he says, a mystic might conceive
himself to have been visited by an angel!</p>

of the Categories was not current till the end of
this century, when all the logic of Aristotle was in the hands
of the doctors. In the earlier Middle Ages, as in the writings
of John of Salisbury and of William of Conches, we hear
even more of Boetius than of the master himself. Virgil,
Seneca and Cicero also were the sources of much of the
culture of this period. Alcuin was a grammarian; he taught
from Priscian and Donatus, improved the eighth century
Latin, and probably made Virgil and Cicero known in Gaul
and Britain. He knew but little Greek, as we infer from his
quotation of the names of the Categories. Erigena knew
more Greek and carried some of it to the Court of Charles the
Bald. See note 2, p. 65. Alcuin probably did not visit Ireland.
Boetius had translated also both Analytics and the Topics.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">9</span></a> Yet Roger Bacon seems to have apprehended both progress
and the relativity of truth. Before Newman, he declared
that God makes no full revelation but gives it in instalments;
and in another passage he speaks of the judgments of
Aristotle, and of other great teachers, &#8220;secundum possibilitatem
sui temporis ... aliud tempus fuit tunc, et aliud nunc
est&#8221;&mdash;a remarkable saying. Of the Saints he says &#8220;they had
their time, we have our own.&#8221; Vid. also note, p. 80.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">10</span></a> Modern French historians do us the honour of annexing
our heroes; in respect of the scholars of the Middle Ages
M. Charles Jourdain has set, or followed, this example. John
of Salisbury, that charming child of renascence, born out
of due time, was first claimed as a Frenchman; then, as
this &#8220;provenance&#8221; becomes untenable, he, and others, are
called &#8220;Anglo-French.&#8221; The University of Paris in the XIIth
century was no more France than Rome was Italy. In our
sedentary arable life we do not realise the nomad habits of our
forefathers. Edward the First would inhabit six distant
castles in less than as many weeks; indeed Great Britain
itself was then no island. The heroes, nay the armies, of
Froissart&#8217;s Story fly about the world in their seasons like
migrating birds. All keen scholars of the West went to
the University of Paris, the daughter of kings and popes,
and the intellectual centre not of a strip of kingdom between
Anjou and the Empire, but of Europe itself. And of the
scholars of Paris, Englishmen were, we hear, the most turbulent,
but the boldest in argument and the most greedy
of learning; this last character perhaps it is that now-a-days
looks least English. Kuno Fischer admires the procession of
great Englishmen down the highway of medieval thought,
from Erigena to Francis Bacon. John was born at Salisbury,
spent thirteen of his early years at the University of Paris, the
best of them in the stormy service of Thomas Becket, and but
the last five as Bishop of Chartres. We do not call Lanfranc
an Englishman, nor even Adrian the Fourth an Italian.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">11</span></a> The name Realism has been improperly used&mdash;improperly
because previously engaged&mdash;to signify the conception of an
objective world, from the play of which our impressions arise,
and of which our impressions are, if not likenesses, at any rate
symbols, as opposed to the name &#8220;Idealism&#8221; which, with a
like violence, has been turned to signify the conception that
the universe of things is but a picture produced by the
evolution of the phenomena of consciousness. The proper
names for these opposite conceptions are of course Noumenalism
and Phenomenalism. Realism proper as a habit
of thought, whatever may have been its provisional uses,
is now a mischievous habit; noumenalism is a harmless
amusement.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">12</span></a> Roscellinus, the Roger Bacon of the eleventh century,
learned, rebellious, lucid and heroic, withstood the Church
for philosophy as did Bacon in the thirteenth for natural
science. It would seem that in heroism at any rate Ab&eacute;lard
was below his master.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">13</span></a> Vid. p. 50.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">14</span></a> The opponents of the theory of the Mass are apt to charge
the Roman Church with the proposition that therein the elements
are changed into &#8220;real&#8221; flesh and blood. In the
nineteenth century, as in the thirteenth, this Church has not, I
believe, determined whether the &#8220;real&#8221; substance be corporeal
or incorporeal, separable or inseparable from the sensible properties
of things; whether in a word it be something or,
as many of us would say, nothing at all. Spinoza regarded
&#8220;substance&#8221; as intelligent and extended.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">15</span></a> Thus it was difficult to claim his authority for one side
or the other. The metaphysical treatises were not known till
the later part of the twelfth century. (See p. 75, note 2.) At
the outset of the Physics Aristotle discusses what nature is in
itself, and defines first elements; in the Second Analytics on
the other hand, although thinking of science as deductive and
expository, he strongly opposes the primary existence of
ideas, though these are predicable of many individuals. By
excess of logical formations, the division of properties, the use
of such terms as &#8220;&#947;&#8051;&#957;&#951; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;,&#8221; &amp;c. &amp;c., he laid himself
open to misconception, and so was readily platonised by his
commentators. It would seem indeed that for Aristotle universals
were not merely propositions obtained by negation of
individual variations, but something more active. A &#957;&#8057;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; became somehow a
&#960;&#959;&#8055;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;; e.g. &#8220;&#7969; &#948;&#951;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#945; &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#962;.&#8221;
His position may be appreciated briefly thus:&mdash;In the Categories
Aristotle speaks of individuals as primarily existent,
while in Met. <span class="smcap">z</span>, and elsewhere, the primary existent is the
form. The inconsistency is, however, more apparent than
real; for in the Categories it is the individual so far as he
represents his natural kind which is primarily existent, whilst
the form which in the Metaphysics is primarily existent occurs
only in the individual. This terse appreciation is one of my
many debts to Dr Jackson.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">16</span></a> It were almost to be desired, for our own lucidity, that
we could get rid of the words cause and law, and use language
significant of order only. Aristotle&#8217;s influence has weighed
heavily in favour of studying &#8220;Causes&#8221; rather than sequences;
thus it is hard to clear our own minds, and impossible to clear
the minds of our pupils, of a genetic notion of causation&mdash;that
an effect comes, as it were, from the womb of its causes.
Even Ockham taught as if causes contained their effects.
Mr Marshall (West. Rev. loc. cit.) is of opinion that Roger
Bacon by his &#8220;non oportet causas investigare&#8221; intended to
confine scientific thought to the relations of phenomena.</p></div>

almost mythical grandeur, arising in the far west, full of new
learning, of lyric enthusiasm, and heroic courage. He did not

against authority, and he protested against mighty
ignorance; neither of which should withstand the persuasion
of right reason. &#8220;Ratio immutabilis ... qu&aelig; ... nullius auctoritatis

We must beware of accepting &#8220;matter&#8221; in the current dualist
sense; for Aristotle himself &#8021;&#955;&#951; was hardly distinguishable
from &#948;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">21</span></a> With every allowance for the phases of church and school
in successive academical generations it seems strange that in
1209 Aristotle should have been forbidden under excommunication,
and in 1231 restored to such favour that for the disciples
of Albert and St Thomas the master almost attained the
authority of a father of the church; the explanation probably
is that &#8220;Aristotle&#8221; meant for a time the paynim interpretations
of Toledo, particularly of the Physics (the Metaphysics were
not translated from the Greek till about 1220); and meant
not this only, but also liberal quotation and incorporation of the
writings of Arab philosophers. To show how learning, even
in the University of Paris, lay under ecclesiastical control,
some extracts from the Edicts of the Synod of Paris and of
Gregory the Ninth may be cited in illustration:&mdash;After directing
that &#8220;Corpus magistri Amaurici extrahatur e cimiterio, et
projiciatur in terram non benedictam&#8221; the Synod farther orders
that the &#8220;Quaternuli [&#8220;Quaternuli&#8221; is translated by Ducange,
Quatuor quart&aelig; chart&aelig;, seu octo folia: i.e. the octavos]
magistri David de Dinant, ... afferantur et comburantur; nec
libri Aristotelis de naturali philosophia, nec Commenta legantur
Parisiis, publice vel secreto. Et hoc sub p&oelig;na excommunicationis
inhibemus.... De libris theologicis scriptis in
romano, pr&aelig;cipimus quod episcopis diocesanis tradantur, et
Credo in Deum et Pater noster in romano, pr&aelig;ter vitas
sanctorum.&#8221; The order two years later confirming these
prohibitions differs but in form. Even the Bull of Gregory in
1231, relieving the schools of this proscription, says, &#8220;Ad h&aelig;c
jubemus ut magistri artium unam lectionem de Prisciano et
unam post aliam ordinarie semper legant, et libris illis naturalibus,
qui in concilio provinciali ex certa causa prohibiti fuere,
Parisiis non utantur, quousque examinati fuerint, et ab omni
errorum suspicione purgati.&#8221; The pope adds paternally,
&#8220;Magistri vero et scholares theologi&aelig;, in facultate quam
profitentur, se studeant laudabiliter exercere, nec philosophos
se ostendant, sed satagant fieri theodocti: nec loquantur in
lingua populi, et populi linguam hebr&aelig;am cum azotica confundentes&#8221;
[azotica or arethica means the profane tongue
(Ducange); Hebrew being a Sancta lingua]. The pantheistic
outburst of the later twelfth century, although deriving in
part from Erigena, was probably fed by the commentary of
Alexander of Aphrodisias. This commentary was widely
read in Arabic and Arab-latin translations, the latter of which
were made, as we know (v. A. Jourdain, p. 123 and seq.), by
Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187). Alexander&#8217;s more material
interpretation of &#8021;&#955;&#951; involved the return of All into God;
hence no resurrection, no future life. In his followers these
doctrines become grosser and grosser, and, fused with other
Arabian doctrine, prepared for and afterwards strengthened
the Averroism of Padua, in the <span class="smcap">xv-xvi</span>th century, in which
system it was taught that the universal soul, dipping for the
time into the individual man, is at death resumed into the
universal soul. This virtual denial of personal immortality was
of course bitterly resented by the Church. (Vid. p. 68, note.)
Thus from the thirteenth century onwards pantheistic infidelity
survived and even defied the menaces and the punishments
of the Church.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">22</span></a> Both Albert and Aquinas were inconsistent. Haur&eacute;au
points out that St Thomas was a vitalist in physics, an animist
in metaphysics, a nominalist in philosophy, and a realist in
theology. &#8220;Il a cherch&eacute; &agrave; reconcilier des morts (i.e. Plato
and Aristotle) qui, toute leur vie, se sont contredits.&#8221; But
even sceptics contradict themselves; and it is fair to add
that St Thomas pushed universals back to immanence in the
Divine mind. For Plato the ideas are thoughts of universal
mind; for Aristotle God, or Nature by its thoughts or plans
determines the lines of phenomena: thus Plato and Aristotle
were more alike than Thomas knew, or Haur&eacute;au admits.
There was no such thing of course as The Scholastic Philosophy,
of which I read again but the other day in a modern
work. Scholasticism is the very various teaching of the schools
of the <span class="smcap">xi-xv</span>th centuries; though its general tendency was
to search rather into the origin and nature than into the
functions of being. The philosophy of the thirteenth century
on the whole was eclectic;&mdash;though perhaps eclectic by confusion
rather than by reconciliation. The rule of authority
prevented an appreciation of the relative values of opinions;
the recognised authorities were equally true, and had to be
dovetailed together somehow. Critical interpretation had not
begun.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">25</span></a> For Aristotle the principle of individuation was matter
and form (vid. note, p. 33); for Averroes it was form; for
St Thomas it was matter. For all &#8220;vitalists&#8221; the identity
of form, soul and life is essential; thus Stahl regarded soul as
bestowing on body all activity, as determining all vital functions.
In Aristotle &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053; is untranslatable = anima and animus&mdash;soul
and vital principle. &#928;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945; again in various writers may mean
anything, from air to spirit or other essence; cf. Arist. De
Generat. An. <span class="smcap">ii.</span> 3, and the &#8220;aura&#8221; of Harvey, and even of
Haller in the same connexion as the fertilising element.</p></div>

Galen, forgotten, and rediscovered. Spiritus vitalis, for Bacon,
was &#8220;aura composita ex flamma et aere&#8221; (cf. &AElig;n. <span class="smcap">vi.</span> 747).
Glisson has been fortunate in two generous judges, in Haller
and Virchow; it would ill become me to depreciate a distinguished
Fellow of my own College, and as a clinical observer
Glisson had considerable merits; but as a physiologist he was
sunk in realism. He was happy in the invention of the
technical term &#8220;irritability,&#8221; but for him this virtue was
as metaphysical an essence as the vital spirit; his prime
motor was not physical. As a philosopher I fear the independent
reader of his works will find him fanciful and
wearisome.</p></div>

&#8220;Air,&#8221; he says in the <i>De generatione</i>, &#8220;is given neither for
the cooling nor the nutrition of animals ... it is as if heat
were rather enkindled within the f&oelig;tus (at birth) than repressed
by the influence of the air.&#8221; Boyle (who says that he
worked under the influence of Harvey&#8217;s discoveries) carried
this matter forward by most interesting and sagacious experiments
with his air-pump. For the layman, I may add that (to
speak generally) before Harvey&#8217;s time respiration was regarded
not as a means of combustion but of refrigeration. How man
became such a fiery dragon was the puzzle!</p></div>

but also by Plato and Aristotle, to the circle. Circular
movement was therefore the most perfect, and therefore

was taken for dynamics. Even Kant confused cause and

(Benn). Caverni (Storia del methodo sperimentale

dynamics; and that he introduced the word &#8220;moment.&#8221; In

any or all quarters, after the manner of Pliny; nor again mere
omniscience; but was the demonstration of a cosmical theory
from all departments of knowledge. When knowledge was a
theological philosophy theologians were bound to supply
thinking men with &#8220;Summ&aelig;,&#8221; or comprehensive applications
and casuistries of it. Hugo of St Victor (d. 1141) and

Surgery became a profession in London.&#8221; Mr Power tells us
that a scheme for the unity of the medical profession in London
was set on foot in 1423, when the surgeons were the more
highly organised body. A &#8220;Rector of Medicine&#8221; was indeed
elected (Master Gilbert Kymer). It is not known how long

and to Lyons, Orleans or Tours. How Paris became the
centre of enlightenment in the Western world is not clear.
The &#8220;palace school&#8221; probably was of no place, but of the
royal retinue; that the School of Paris was made up of
those of St Genevi&egrave;ve, St Germain des Pr&egrave;s and the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">49</span></a> The &#8220;Arabs&#8221; were a mixed throng of orientals; some of
them were Aryans, as the Persians and Nestorians; some were
Arabs, Syrians, or Hebrews. The Nestorians were eminent as
physicians, and it is interesting to this College to know that one
of the best translators of Aristotle into Arabic was Johannitius,
a Nestorian physician. The Eastern peoples, as the Western,
owed all to the Greeks except a double measure of dialectical
ingenuity, which was their own, and is their own to-day. By the
incisive methods of Aristotle the Christian neo-platonists had
been variously carved into heretics&mdash;such as the Monophysites;
and these when driven eastwards carried Greek to Edessa
and Bagdad: from these centres it was, and from Nisibur in
Persia and elsewhere, that the &#8220;Saracens&#8221; drew their culture.
Aristotle was first translated into Arabic in the reign of Al
Mansur, the son of Har&ucirc;n al Raschid (813-833); Avicenna
carried the Aristotelian encyclopedia to its culmination; and
Cordova in the tenth century was as full of fervid disciples as
was Paris in the thirteenth. The Arabian medicine was Aristotle
and Galen. The Arabian philosophy was originally built
upon the Alexandrian emanations and hypostases (the soul of
the universe, intelligence the first of creatures, nature and
mutability, and so forth). Essences and forms were produced, as
the &#8220;intelligibilia&#8221; of &#8220;real&#8221; knowledge, till, as some one has
wittily put it, &#8220;universals became almost palpable.&#8221; Avicenna
indeed approached understanding from the senses, and Averroes
accepted this right position; but he taught the permanent
subsistence of intelligence, as a sphere in a hierarchy of
spiritual principles independent of matter and persons. In no
long time this was turned into the unity, as opposed to the
individuality, of the soul; the universal soul dipping as it were
into the individual, and at his death returning into the universal;
a virtual denial of personal immortality. Hence the
bitter defiance of Albert and St Thomas. The Averroistic
doctrines were enthusiastically propagated on the other hand
by that &#8220;malleus Ecclesiae Romanae&#8221; Frederick the Second
(1212-1250). The Arabian science consisted in medicine,
mathematics, astronomy, and alchemy. Averroes it was who
first asserted the independence of the spheres of science
and religion; a division popular at the present day, and one
which lent itself to many a convenient subterfuge, in Padua.</p></div>

may regard Michael as the founder of Paduan Averroism.

attractive figure, and deserves his renown as the greatest of
the medieval sages. His endowments were richer and wider
than those of the great Italian logician, his pupil, whose name
has had a greater vogue, and whose doctrines are still the
accepted discipline of the Church of Rome. Albert restored
Aristotle, and in astronomy and chemistry sought for truth in
nature. That St Thomas was a man of the highest intellectual
power and attainments, an eminence which is claimed for
him by many scholars, as by Mr Vernon in his edition
of the Paradise, I cannot admit; unless it be to a critical
scholar who has mastered the contents of his many folios, if
such a scholar there be. For my part, after reading much of
what is written of St Thomas, I have but done what was possible
to me in other such cases; that is, I have run my eye over
the titles of his books and chapters, and formed some rapid
judgment here and there of the ways of his thought. Now I
venture to assert that the ways of the thought of Aquinas,
subtle and symmetrical as they are, lie wholly within the
formulas of his age. He left science for logic, the stuff of
thought for its instrument; satisfying himself with such
tinkling cymbals as &#8220;Nihil potest per se operari, nisi quod
per se subsistit; ... Impossibile est quod forma separetur a
seipsa ... quod subsistens per se desinat esse&#8221; ... and so forth.
Albert though a less symmetrical is a more original genius.
To Aquinas indeed I should hesitate to attribute genius; to
Albert it seems to me this title may be granted, if with some
hesitation. &#8220;Vir famosus et erroneus&#8221; was Roger Bacon&#8217;s
summary of Albert&#8217;s career, but Bacon was scarcely an

some of these letters has been called in question by M. Charles
Jourdain, but in any case they are contemporary, and consonant
with Robert&#8217;s acts and character. Moreover, two years
before, Innocent had suspended the bishop for refusing to
induct an Italian, ignorant of English, to a rich benefice in his
diocese. I find that Dr Luard, in 1880, had no doubts of the
authenticity of these letters (Encycl. Brit. XI. 211). Mons.

into Latin direct from the Greek; and by the use of the
Greek text itself. These means were modified again by the
chances of access to particular authors, and, as in the case of
Aristotle for example, to particular treatises. To ascertain
the dates of access to these new sources I have made
some search; and herein I have found great help in the
&#8220;Recherches critiques&#8221; of Amable Jourdain. We must
remember that though the source of Western culture is not
Latin, but Greek, yet its meagre channels in medieval Europe
were Latin; its best tradition lay in Lucretius, Cicero, Seneca,
Virgil. The ill-starred Boetius was the last of the Grecians.
Greek was driven East and West: West into Ireland, where
in the ninth century a few Greek MSS. survived, and were read
in the original by Erigena and his disciples; but this Irish
Greek tradition was soon lost, and there were no teachers of
Greek. Yet it seems certain that, in Oxford, Robert of Lincoln
and Adam Marsh had at any rate learned assistance in the
production of some Greco-latin translations of Aristotle, of the
Ethics for example. Dr Jackson has pointed out to me a
passage in Aquinas&#8217; Commentary on the Ethics, where
&#8220;the presentation of the right reading misspelt, and of a
ludicrous etymology side by side with one which is very nearly
right, seem to show that, whilst Aquinas had about him people
who knew Greek, he himself had no substantial knowledge of
it.&#8221; Grosseteste himself may have had some efficient knowledge
of Greek; &#8220;vir in latino et in greco peritissimus,&#8221; says
Matthew Paris. Dr Jackson (in a private letter) feels assured
that &#8220;Roger Bacon was plainly a competent Greek scholar.
Of this there is proof in the <i>Opera inedita</i>, edited by Brewer
for the Master of the Rolls.&#8221; We know also that more than one
scholar of the 11-12th centuries travelled in the East, though,
as Dr Daremberg says, travellers to the East were more apt to
bring back false relics than genuine manuscripts. There was a
small Greek community and a Greek monastery at Auriol, near
the old colony of Marseilles. Still, for lack of masters and
materials, Greek then was a very rare accomplishment; and it
is manifest, from much internal evidence, that Albert had no
Greek; though he certainly possessed Greco-latin translations
of some few Aristotelian treatises by other hands, of the <i>De
anima</i> and of the Physics for example, whence he makes quotations
without interspersion of Arabic titles, proper names,
nouns and terms, such as he rather helplessly reproduces in
his rendering of the ninth book of the <i>De c&aelig;lo</i> and elsewhere.
We know from other sources that a few treatises, such as the
<i>De anima</i>, and the first two books of the Ethics, existed
in Greco-latin rendering before the Arab-latin versions of
Michael Scot and others (1220-1225). In later life Albert
had the assistance of Aquinas to whom we have attributed
some knowledge of Greek; for we find Aquinas, with the
countenance of Urban the Fourth, not only searching
Europe for Greek manuscripts, sending emissaries to Spain
to make versions for him, and supervising the preparation
of translations directly into Latin, but also personally
comparing the Latin translations with the Greek texts of
the Ethics and Politics, and recording variants; variants
which Albert copied from his disciple. (It may be worthy of
remark that even so late as 1586 there were no Greek types
in Oxford, and that in 1599 Casaubon (Life by Pattison) could
find no compositors for Greek in Lyons.) The great debt of
the West to the Arabs was a new enthusiasm for learning, and
for the &#8220;Princeps philosophorum&#8221;; not their travestied texts
and unwieldy commentaries, which Roger Bacon, probably
perceiving that his contemporaries swore by the Arab rather
than by the Greek, wished he could burn.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59" id="Footnote_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59"><span class="label">59</span></a> To wonder why Roger Bacon became a clerk and a
Franciscan is to look upon the thirteenth century with the
eyes of the nineteenth. The vision of St Francis had not
grown dim; the strange beauty of his life held men captive
still, and his cheerful natural religion still animated his
disciples. None could have said more truly than St Francis

<p>The grey friar of the fourteenth century, as we know him in
Langland and Chaucer, or later in the degraded fanaticism of
the Observants, had fallen far from the example of his master.
Perhaps the chief reason for Bacon&#8217;s decision was that his
friend Grosseteste, who on the first coming of the friars wrote
eloquently to Gregory the Ninth of their illumination, humility
and piety, was a member of the Order, and was the first of its
Rectors in Oxford. (Rd. Grosseteste, Epist. ed. Luard; Rolls,
1861, p. 179.) Even in Cambridge, till 1877, teachers and
professors, save those of Law or Medicine, were generally
speaking in holy orders; for instance, the following
extract, of date 1849, which I owe to the kindness of
Dr Donald MacAlister, &#8220;C&aelig;terum neminem in socium unquam
admitti volumus qui non sit aut Theologiam professurus
et sacros ordines post certum temporis intervallum inferius
definiendum suscepturus aut e Collegio discessurus, nisi unus
e duobus sociis qui Medicin&aelig; aut ex illis duobus qui Juris
Civilis studio deputati sunt, electus fuerit.&#8221; (Stat. Coll. Div.
Joh. Evan. Cant. cap. xii. 28 April, 12 Vict. 1849.) To this
hour in England the clergy command the public schools. In
a warlike society learning and contemplation must fall to the
clergy; without the fortresses of war or learning, if there was
any safety, there was not dignity or peace. The mendicant
orders were young institutions, ascendant, and in favour with
the great. Of their usurpations in the universities I have
spoken. Within them even Popes could not meddle, as Bacon
found to his sorrow. Hales and Ockham also became Minors,
as Albert and St Thomas, both of illustrious descent, became
Preachers. Moreover the Franciscans had devoted themselves
to the care of the sick, and especially of those smitten with the
new pestilences&mdash;such as leprosy, syphilis, and plague&mdash;which
Oriental dirt and asceticism had engendered or inflamed; and
thus a bent to observation of natural phenomena may have
been encouraged (see art. Roger Bacon, Westminster Rev. loc.
cit.). To say that to the monks we owe the conservation of
learning is not so true as to say that learned men betook
themselves to the religious houses in order to find relief from
turmoil, to secure the subsistence of life without its cares, to
get access to books, and to profit by the counsel of comrades
who had enjoyed not only the culture of their own house, but
also the interchange of ideas and manuscripts with all the
learned houses in Europe. When these advantages were to be
had in the world, learning deserted the monasteries. Again,
Bacon was not an unbeliever, nor anything like it; in the <i>Opus
Majus</i> he declares the Holy Scriptures to be the source of
all truth; not only, like Socrates before him and Kant after
him, did he fix his eyes on moral perfection as the end, but
also on the Church as the means: on the other hand the resentments
of passionate genius under harsh duress did not make
a naturally rebellious temper more tractable. &#8220;Fames et mora
bilem conciunt.&#8221; It is evident that within the Franciscan
order there were three well-marked parties; namely, of the
naturalists, as Bacon; of the mystics, as Bonaventura; and of
the sophists, as John Duns the Northumbrian. Now Bacon&#8217;s
troubles did not begin till the succession to the Generalship of
the Order of the seraphic Bonaventura, an argumentative mystic
(like Duns, and unlike the ecstatic mystics of St Victor), who,
rejecting Aristotle, had steeped himself in the neo-platonism of
Augustine and &#8220;Dionysius the Areopagite&#8221;; and Bonaventura
and his party it was who stopped Bacon&#8217;s mouth at Oxford, and
shut him up in Paris. What the life of Bacon and the direction
of medieval thought might have been had Grosseteste been
able to spare Adam Marsh from Oxford for the Generalship it
were perhaps too curious to consider; yet we may profitably
remember that Bacon, brushing aside Porphyry and his questions,
and denouncing the &#8220;vain physics&#8221; of Paris, urged that
enquiry should begin with the simplest objects of research,
and rise gradually to the higher and higher; every observation
being controlled by experiment. He says indeed that by
experiment only can we distinguish a sophism from a demonstration.
(Op. Tert. <span class="smcap">xix.</span>) Earnestly he tried to follow this
method; he seems to have spent on it substance of his own,
and, after this was exhausted, to have appeared for the first
time in history as a petitioner for &#8220;scientific grants in aid.&#8221;
Diderot speaks of Bacon as &#8220;Un des g&eacute;nies les plus surprenants
que la nature ait produits, et un des hommes les plus
malheureux&#8221;; he lived in vain, died unhonoured, and left no
disciple.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_63" id="Footnote_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63"><span class="label">63</span></a> Oxford fell in the first instance under Franciscan influence,
yet Alexander Hales (of this order) gave the peripatetic
bent to Oxford which it retains to this day. Creed rather
than conduct was the dominant note of the Faith (p. 85); it
is interesting therefore to learn that for Oxford Robert of
Lincoln and Adam Marsh translated, or procured a translation
of, the Ethics. On the probability that Grosseteste had
some substantial knowledge of Greek, see p. 75, note 2.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_64" id="Footnote_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64"><span class="label">64</span></a> In Casaubon&#8217;s diary we get a glimpse of Oxford in 1613.
The University was wealthy enough; it had escaped the Paris
devastation, but had scarcely deserved its good fortune.
There was much active teaching of a routine kind, many formalities,
much serving of tables; but of living interest in
science, learning, or high culture there was not a trace. Of
classical learning, in Casaubon&#8217;s sense, there was naught.
Ecclesiastical controversies absorbed or overwhelmed all other
subjects; and the University was regarded by the Government
as an instrument of party. The professors were all clerks, and
ardent only as pamphleteers. Thus, says Pattison, &#8220;the
University took its full share of national passion, prejudice
and religious sentiment, but was wholly destitute of any power
to vivify, to correct, to instruct, or to enlighten.&#8221; Pattison&#8217;s
Casaubon, p. 417.</p></div>

College rather than Harvey&#8217;s strenuous control of tradition and

by direct experimental verification.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_69" id="Footnote_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69"><span class="label">69</span></a> Niccol&ograve; Leonico (I give his Latin name in the text as
Ueberweg gives it) seems to have been a spirited and effective
philosophical lecturer of Hellenist and critical qualities, and
of much charm both of style and character. He is not to be
confounded with his elder contemporary, Nicolaus Leonicenus,
of Vicenza and Ferrara, professor of medicine and an elegant
latiner, who translated the aphorisms of Hippocrates; and
whose friend Linacre, in translating parts of Galen, did a like
service to medicine and letters in England.</p></div>

it, perhaps as fully as did Sir Thomas Browne. The <i>De

records, either of particular cases or of diseases in a more
general sense, which seem to have been instituted by Thadd&aelig;us
of Florence in the thirteenth century, were abundant in
the fifteenth, and were continued into the sixteenth, and even
later. In the fifteenth century these records have a considerable
historical value, and no little clinical interest, as
the questions to the patient and the records of symptoms are
often orderly and graphic, and enable the modern reader
to revise the diagnoses, many of them grotesque enough.
These Consilia make a great bulk of matter, and one which
has not been thoroughly explored. A general account of the
Consilia may be read in any good history of medicine, but
perhaps the most interesting is to be found in the chapters on
medieval medicine in Daremberg&#8217;s &#8220;Histoire et Doctrines&#8221;
(e.g. tom. 1. p. 334 et seq.).</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
